"- Your websites are different across countries e.g. different offers in France and UK and as a French national in the UK, I did want to compare both options as I could have flown from either a French or English airport. <br/>- Impossible for me to get direct flights from the UK (to Naples) and recommended flight path was very nonsensical (shouldn't have been offered) (showing 1 or 2 stops)<br/>- Once I called Kuoni UK I was told we could actually choose different flights and a nice person took all my details and said I would receive a quote / travel itineary within 48 hours. I never heard back...<br/>- In the end, I found the hotel I was looking to book with you was also available on Jet2 and I ended up booking with them. They were very quick and sleek. So sadly, I think I might continue look for your travel options and hotel and book with another operator."
"<br/>I have just returned from my honeymoon in the Seychelles which was really poor. My wife has a dairy allergy and when we came into the Milton Keynes Kuoni branch to book the trip we were incredibly open-minded and flexible with destination to ensure the hotel were able to cater for Hannah as a top priority. This was spoken about throughout the booking process with the travel agent in store.<br/><br/>We ended up booking a half board trip to the Seychelles which was significantly over our budget based on assurances that she would be catered for as the travel agent who booked it for us, had said she had also been to the STORY hotel.<br/><br/>When we arrived at the accommodation we quickly realised that this is not something which the hotel accommodates for. No meal that we had in the hotel was labelled to accommodate the allergy and when we notified the staff of the allergy, their reaction was surprised and this appeared to be uncommon. This led to numerous instances where Hannah are dairy when we ate within the hotel which caused illness, distress and discomfort. We kept having to speak with management from the hotel on the issue and complain but no change was made.<br/><br/>Ricky arranged for $150 room credit to be given to us a good will gesture. When we tried to use this credit there was confusion from the hotel staff which led to even more uncomfortable conversations.  Following the third dietary issue we got in contact with Ricky again. <br/><br/>During the email exchange with Ricky he stated that there has been problems with the hotel in this regard previously. This made me more angry that I could put into words. <br/><br/>We were assured that we wouldn't have this problem, only to be told that it was something that was known once we had paid the money. This is totally unacceptable and frankly the way we were sold the holiday was misrepresented.<br/><br/>Allergies are dangerous and if they are not accommodated for appropriately can lead to longer term discomfort and sickness.<br/><br/>Kuoni have built their reputation on providing luxurious escapism. As our honeymoon is a once in a lifetime trip we wanted to experience this. What we actually experienced was nothing close to it.<br/>"
"1. We've used Kuoni for over 15 years and yet our details and past trips were not able to be located at the initial query.<br/>2. Asked for 5* accommodation for a beach holiday with local restaurants/villages available for a belated 70th Birthday celebration. Advisor convinced us that the package met these requirements.<br/>3. First hotel, Marina Resort, Karon Beach was a total disaster!<br/>- Reception/lobby bare and no information/photos etc, etc; unwelcoming<br/>- Staff very passive, not unfriendly but certainly not friendly <br/>- hotel in need of complete refurbishment; shabby rooms<br/>- no facilities etc except for pool (which was nice)<br/>- no bar for socialising by hotel clients<br/>- no sunbeds anywhere near the beach<br/>- no activities at all (yoga, water, aerobic etc)<br/>- Images and write up in brochure is absolutely not representative of the hotel<br/>- Next door was the 'Tanni Terrace' club with loud clubbing music into the early hours every night and worse at weekends<br/>- Local area totally inappropriate; 'weed' shops every 50 yards, Not a nice area at all<br/>- Hotel & local area full of loud Russians!<br/>4. Second hotel, Paradise Khaolak, was far better, great room, friendly personable staff, good location, walkable into the 'town' but a quiet area. Still not 5* however.<br/>5 Kuoni rep at Marina (Apple) tried to help but was ill and unable to meet, we had a text conversation, eventually offered a move to another hotel which we turned down on the basis that it would lose us a day of our holidays and 3 days had already gone by.<br/>In summary we were very disappointed with the first location/hotel recommendation which was totally unsuitable and did not meet our criteria.  The second location/hotel was an improvement but did not meet our criteria. We also heavily question the value to money aspect of the holiday.<br/>I will write in more detail but it is doubtful we will be making any further recommendations to friends and family to use Kuoni."
100% would recommended again
5* service. Listen to what is important to you and come up with great options. Tailored to requirements. Have been with Kuoni before and service extends to whilst you are on holiday.
A bit of a delay in initial response due to vacation etc but very helpful once communication made
"A bit of a disappointing visit to Southampton Kuoni. Having heard about the fantastic honeymoon my brother went on with this company we were excited to see what was in store for us with a 12K budget. Unfortunately, it transpired that yes three very nice hotels were selected for our trip, but very little else. There was no mention of any trips, expeditions, cultural spots to visit. Quite literally, three nice hotels in different locations and sort it yourself. Not quite what we had in mind for a luxury travel company with a great personal recommendation."
A contact from a Kuoni representative while we were in Canada
"A couple of elements could be added to make the holiday go even more smoothly:<br/>a) Introduce a ‘baggage allowance equalisation’ option on booking for those who are taking multiple flights, with different baggage allowances. Customers could pay, on booking, the additional cost of ensuring all baggage had the same allowance. This would make check in processes smoother at the airport.<br/>b) For customers who have a late flight back home, to arrange for them to have a late check out from the hotel. <br/>"
"A couple of points knocked off as we had to chase up for our holiday reference number etc very close to the date of the holiday as these weren't sent over. We have used Kuoni for every holiday we have been on as a couple, including our honeymoon, and this is the only issue we have encountered."
a few little changes last minute and lake of information re the resort
A few things could have been better
A friendly professional knowledgable service identifying exactly the holiday we were looking for.
A good itinerary well documented
A great and friendly service.
A lack of attention to detail and to responding to customer needs/request. Customer requests not met.
A little expensive
A more affordable price would be very helpful. Direct flights would be very appealing especially with mobility issues to be able to reduce transfers would be excellent news.
"A thoroughly enjoyable holiday, that had a very stressful start. I have written to you regarding this in a separate email.  My only slightly negative comment, there were some long periods out on safari were we had to go 5 hours without access to the toilet, which for us ladies was rather a trial."
"A very enjoyable, easy experience"
A very helpful and knowledgeable agent. She knew the places we wished to visit and could advise us with suitable suggestions.
"Aaron was excellent, more than help and very patient, would highly recommend him and the Meadowhall branch"
"Aaron was very friendly and professional, he also provided us with several options for our holiday. The options to do twin hotels on our holiday will give us the flexibility to see a lot more."
Aaronâ€™s advice in store was superb. He really understood what we were looking for and was extremely knowledgeable. He provided us with a great selection of options and also found us a promotional offer at a similar resort.
"Absolutely amazingly kind and helpful assistants, they explained everything and made each single step very clear. Alice was very helpful and quick. 
Very happy with the offer and the communication."
"Absolutely fantastic service from all at Kuoni, especially Rikki Kingswell. We had to postpone a couple of times from 2021 due to illness and he was great at keeping on top of things."
"Adam Kennedy at Gateshead branch was great, really kind, knowledgeable and really seemed interested in what me and my husband were wanting to do and see.  Having been all around the USA previously we were able to swap stories, tips  and experiences which he could pass onto customers from me and I could use the information he gave me.   I had previously thought that Kuoni would be really expensive but we got a great deal, and he was able to book our internal flights immediately instead of having to get prices from a third party provider which slot of the other travel agents have to do.  Would definitely book again here, first class service.  When we came back the following day to book our holiday Adam wasn’t in but we sorted it all out with a lady called Nicola who was just as accommodating as Adam had been the previous day.  excellent Customer service"
Adam our advisor was very knowledgeable not pushy but gave us lots of options and took the time to alter things to suit our budget and preferences.
After order placed Gareth Dredge very diligent to see my seating and other details and requirements were satisfactory.
"After quotation was given at the second attempt, we were told to expect a call at a certain time on a given day but neither calls were received. Having travelled with Kuoni in the past this was very disappointing"
"Agent initially booked the wrong transfer, but Kuoni honoured the original price. Good service."
"Alix O'brien worked tirelessly with My Husband and I to secure our dream trip, a truly 5 star  service"
Alix was helpful and patient with a lot of tweaks on the booking. She also was honest about what would work and what wouldn't for my family.
Alix was so helpful and quick to respond to my every query
"All arrangements excellent, also the advice from Kuoni Manchester"
All arrangements were carried out via telephone and email. I was delighted by the professional and friendly service that I  received.
All drops-offs and picks up went well. The hotels were excellent.
All great thanks apart from not having a wake up call on my final morning at 5.30
All I ask is for the whole holiday to work as agreed - it did.
All perfect
"All staff at Kuoni are professional, friendly, supportive and knowledgeable."
All staff fantastic and coffee
All the reps we dealt with were fantastic - especially Ian in Sri Lanka who was quick at sorting an issue we had
All went according to plan. No issues regarding transfers/ tours.
All went ver smoothly
Allison Todd was fantastic to deal with
"Although BA say that you can check in up to an hour before your flight that isn't true. When I arrived to check in over two hours before my flight, as I was told it wasn't a problem by Kuoni, it was in fact a problem as BA had oversold the flight so I almost didn't have a seat on the plane and had to wait until 45 minutes before my flight to know whether I was actually going on holiday. It was very stressful and upsetting so if you could just let people know to book on line before they leave home as it seems the over selling of seats is common practice."
"Although there were a few hiccoughs along the way in sorting and booking the holiday, service given by Jack Pike was exceptional!"
Always a great personal service.
"Always helpful, friendly and knowledgeable"
"Always looked after by Sam at the Liverpool store , always outstanding service and we trust her 100% the staff at this store are the main reason we keep on re booking with Kuoni"
"Always the best service from kuoni, very friendly and always ready to help would recommend to everyone"
Amazing holiday. Oman wasn’t a place we would have looked at. But on the recommendation of your staff we decided to give it a go. So glad we did
Amazing process throughout. Kuoni recommended resorts after a thorough discussion of our wishes and what we wanted. We will deffinately be rebooking
Amazing service - we were especially impressed with the meet and greet in the Maldives to the Kuoni service on our return at Mala airport who took us right through to the check-in desk!!
Amazing service so friendly and kind and extremely helpful. Answered any questions I had was super happy walking out and will be back to book my holiday
Amazing! Zoe took care of everything. Really catered to our needs and budget
Amy was brilliant. Putting together multiple proposals / options and being totally non-phased when we twice changed the brief.  She was always quick to respond and worked hard to find us a holiday within budget.
Amy was very knowledgeable and helped us find exactly what we were looking for. Could not be happier with the service and advice provided.
Amy was very polite and efficient
"An excellent, friendly and efficient service."
"An incredible holiday, Katja was so helpful and made the holiday even better  with her knowledge - she was 10/10"
"Angelo at the resort was fantastic, however Sharna from the Metro Centre store regularly fails to respond to emails and takes a number of prompts."
"Angelo our rep was fantastic, gave great tips at the start of the holiday"
"Another amazing experience with Kuoni! After booking our honeymoon through Kuoni and being hugely impressed with the service the first time around, we decided to use their service again to book a special holiday. Katie at the Southampton branch was incredible and catered to our every need, providing suggestions and options to make our trip as special as possible whilst also keeping the trip within budget. Thanks to Katie’s expert knowledge and help, we’ve now also booked an additional element to our trip which at first wasn’t something we’d considered. Thank you Katie, we can’t wait for our holiday :)"
Answered all my questions and came up with some really good ideas.
Apart from a bit of a hiccup early on in the booking process relating to a change in staff member dealing with the account where significant information was not passed on my relationship with and service from Kuoni (Southhampton and then Winchester office) has been excellent.
"As a one off total experience , the service was exceptonal -"
As always efficient and friendly service.  We knew where we wanted to stay so our booking was quite straightforward.
"As always the staff are professional, knowledgeable and understand your travel requirements and spend time building your holiday around that information"
"As always, an extremely knowledgeable team at Kuoni in Peter Jones. Feel welcomed every time I visit, almost never have to think about where to go as members of the team, Stacey ( since moved) Donna, Steve and Lucy seem to know and understand where would be ideal."
"As always, great prompt service, good range of options and booking process very smooth."
"As an independent traveller, I'd always thought arranging my own travel plans, gave more options, greater flexibility and usually at a better price, until I visited Kuoni. 
Michael, my travel advisor, used his experience and expertise to tailor the most wonderful holiday, which not only met, but exceeded my own original plans and a lesser cost ! 
Thank you Michael ??"
"As older clients would have liked to have been provided with more information earlier - details regarding  visas for example, but everything went pretty much like clockwork once we arrived."
"As soon as we went in to the Meadowhall store, we were greeted by Jenny and she was so knowledgeable and patient with us. She listened to what we were looking for and built us the most perfect itinerary for our honeymoon and gave us different choices of hotel for each location. We were looking for a mixture of interesting things to see and do as well as the option to relax in beautiful beach locations and hotels and she came up with the perfect balance. She was also conscious of our budget the whole way through and let us know if we could have any upgrades. Once weâ€™d booked, I had a few questions and she responded very quickly which made the whole process stress free. We had looked into other honeymoons elsewhere, but the service we received at Kuoni was far and beyond anything we had received elsewhere. We would 100% go back to Kuoni."
As usual we had a fabulous booking experience with our holiday recommended and tailored to our needs.
"Asked for a quote with minimal information, Claire Gately, prepared a quotes exactly of what I wanted thinking of the little details"
Attention to detail was impeccable.
"Attention to detail when booking left a lot to be desired, then when it came to paying the balance I needed to make a phone call to customer services as the link from Kuoni account wasn't working."
Attention to detail when trying to create the perfect trip with the plans we had. Working hard to create a tailored holiday for our needs.
Attention to detail when trying to create the perfect trip with the plans we had. Working hard to create a tailored holiday for our needs.
Attentive staff who listened and advised.
"Awful.
21 phone calls in 4 days has really put me off using Kuoni to book a holiday ever again."
"Beautiful new store in Liverpool One, felt very welcome and the staff are extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  Jane Griffiths the store manager was fantastic."
"Beautiful, peaceful location <br/> Wonderful food"
"Becky was knowledgable, friendly and professional and clearly knew both the countries I was enquiring about."
Becky was really helpfu. She listened and understood our requirements and made very helpful suggestions. We shall be visiting again at the weekend.
"Being Kuoni customers many times we were not surprised that everything went smoothly, as per usual!"
Being of a certain age paper tickets would be nice alongside e-ticket
Bekki Turner in Manchester was very professional
Bekki was extremely professional and helpful throughout the booking process - providing us with helpful info prior to our visit in store that made for an efficient and enjoyable experience in-store. We also feel like she and/or Kuoni representatives are only ever a phone call away either before or during our once in a lifetime trip.
Best holiday I’ve ever had!
Better  assistance at Male airport.
Booking and investigation process worked well. Will have no problem in using Kuoni for future holidays.
"Booking our trip through Kuoni was a positive experience overall. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable during the booking process, and their attention to detail was impressive - i.e. dietary requirements and room preferences. <br/><br/>However, we encountered some difficulty contacting them to arrange extra excursions once our trip was booked. Despite this minor frustration, once we were able to reach someone, they were able to help us efficiently and we booked our excursions. <br/><br/>Overall, we still recommend Kuoni as a travel agent. Their expertise and customer service during the initial booking process were top-notch, and we felt well taken care of when on holiday by our local guide."
Booking process v. efficient.  Local rep could be better
"Both of our booked private transfers were 110 per cent messed up. The first one the driver went to Milan instead of Lake Como which was a dreadful mistake, the second driver in Milan turned up thinking he was taking us to the local airport not the main one and he was very angry and the receptionist had to translate for my husband as the driver spoke very little English, we were lucky to get to the airport in time for the check in slot, the whole episode did not do our blood pressures any good as it was very stressful. With regards to Lake Como we should have been picked up at 11am so we had vacated our room which was a 12 noon check out time, the driver eventually turned up after 3pm!! If it wasn’t for the wonderful Hotel Victoria and its incredibly caring staff the day would have been more of a nightmare than it was and it was stress both of us could have done without. What irritated me even more was that when the driver saw us he never even said sorry.<br/>"
Brilliant.  Extremely helpful with excellent suggestions and superb at going the extra mile to get us exactly the holiday we wanted.
"Called in at your branch in Meadowhall to look at booking a holiday. Told the lady what we’d like we to do , we could see that another couple was waiting so she said she would call the day after and send email. This didn’t happen. By Tuesday I had to phone to get the quotes which was not on our preferred dates. Took a week for the lady to phone to see what we thought. By this time we’d booked through someone else. Got the feeling that she thought we couldn’t afford it. Very let down."
"Called up on a Sunday afternoon, could tell it was before closing time. Gave the colleague the dates available for travel, the hotels id been interested in and the airports I can fly from and she came back with completely different dates of availability. <br/>Oh well let me know what you think…was the response not I’m so sorry leave it with me and I’ll see if there are any alternatives that would be suitable etc. <br/>called Citalia as I always do- booked no problem the hotel I wanted, the dates I had available and flights from a local airport."
"Calum and Graham were incredible. They gave my mum and I VIP service. They were warm and welcoming. Calum took time with us to plan out every detail, there was no feeling of pressure and when he learned it was my birthday he was so sweet about it.

I have every intention of going back to them again many times in the future, I couldn't be more impressed. I can now see why Kuoni are such a prestigious brand after the utterly wonderful experience we had in Edinburgh."
Came into shop gave my requirements but I never heard back about any travel plan
Can not improve on perfection.
Can’t really think of anything that would improve our experience of our meeting with Chris
Can’t think of anything
Cannot find fault
"Charlotte is exceptionally knowledgeable, and wonderful to work with on our holiday plans."
Charlotte was extremely helpful and went above and beyond to help us find what we needed.
Charlotte was great. Friendly and efficient.
Charlotte was very helpful
"Charlotte, at the Meadowhall branch, continues to be incredibly helpful"
Check-in time was incorrect.. family with children were originally seated separately on the plane<br/>Late checkout should have been offered given evening flight time and prior knowledge of last boat times<br/>
Chelsea from Solihull office has been very helpful in all of our recent bookings and enquiries
Chelsea Webb went above and beyond to help build the perfect holiday!
"Cheryl, the Chester store advisor was really good.  She spent several hours searching for holidays and made the booking experience very straightforward.  We were sent all relevant paperwork for our holiday. I would have appreciated a phone call or email prior to our departure just to make sure everything was okay and relevant paperwork completed."
Chris Perry at the Manchester store provided exceptional service and accommodated us at last minute without an appointment.
Chris Perry in the Manchester shop and Sheela the rep in Mauritius were fantastic
"Chris was well briefed after my initial call to book an appointment. He then listened, heard and retained our initial wants and needs very well. He made relevant suggestions to maximise our experience value from the trips, and kept promises on follow up after our visit. 
Didn't push for quick decisions but made himself very available and approachable."
Chynna and your disability team were amazing they were understanding and extremely helpful
CLAIRE FROM THE MK OFFICE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE HELPFUL.
Communication and organisation of transfers was good.
Completely pleased with the service. Will definitely be booking with Kuoni again……..very soon!!
Confusing messages at the outset
Continue to be the best
Could have bought the exact same holiday for £800 less through Jet2 Holidays.  Can’t see I got anything for my extra £800.
Couldn’t match jet2 and couldn’t offer the luxury rooms that jet2 could which suprised me
"Creating, tailoring and booking our holiday with you was really good. You were so helpful when we then had to reschedule. Your communications are excellent - you actually answer the phone and know what to do when we ring! You got everything right and always rang back when you said you would. A rare & precious approach to customer service these days. The reps in resort were attentive and helpful and made finding our way to the correct checkin at airports simple. The transfers ran without any hitch and were invaluable. We would undoubtedly come to Kuoni again for a long haul holiday."
"Customer service prior to flying was great, informative. We had a problem with one of our transfers which I am still waiting on a call from Kuoni about"
"Customer service was exceptional, but a rather expensive quote ."
"Customer service was on the whole excellent. However, when we said we didnâ€™t wish to fly from London, we meant it. But our options were limited, either go a couple of weeks earlier and stay for a considerable higher cost or fly from Gatwick. Funnily enough, we did book via an independent agent, exactly the same hotel and room grade, flying from our preferred airport and at our preferred time for quite a lower price simply because they looked to book the flights with different carriers. What made us laugh was itâ€™s with Kuoni ðŸ˜‚"
Definitely recommend using Kuoni
"Denise in the team at Winchester was as helpful , knowledgeable and fun to talk to as always. I know I can always trust hers and the whole teamâ€™s knowledge and advice"
"Did have nice conversation with representative and we talked about possible Barbados holidays for next Spring.  I did know one hotel we would consider so provided that and asked for other suggestions.  Received quote with pretty pictures of Barbados at more than I wanted to spend, and it did not seem at all personal.  Just two hotels and a quote for £16,000 plus."
"Difficulties encountered booking restaurants, kids clubs via Kuoni with hotel. It would have been easier if Kuoni suggested I dealt with the hotel myself from the outset. Limited availability for bookings despite providing our requests for our multi-generation two months ahead."
"Disappointed with the transport to and from the hotel. Previously had a nice car. This time was a minibus, one of which was noisy and uncomfortable"
Documents arrive too late<br/>Lack of flight info and appropriate action needed
does what it says on the tin
Don’t feel that the suggested itinerary offer good value for money and much more expensive than I know I can get elsewhere. Quite disappointed as in the past your travel experts have been very good.
Don’t leave families sitting separated on long flights
Don’t use BA. Also Aspire Lounge too busy. Letting people in without a booking!! Not comfortable
Dubai representative more interested in selling tous and events than looking after customers.
Easily approachable. at the store in Milton Keynes. Helpful  & very friendly people
Efficient and professional
Efficient booking process. When contacted staff about additional requirements they responded very promptly. Trip went off very smoothly. Very good hotels (E&O Penang Traders KL). Private transfers on time and courteous (Asian Trails). Would have appreciated more information on local trips in Penang.
"Effortless process from start to finish. Kirsty in Solihull was great putting our package together. Communication, information and service after booking all perfect. Fantastic booking experience and holiday. Thank you!"
"Effortless process on my part - Kuoni came up with different options and gave me time to consider, then refined the options based on my feedback"
"Elysium is always a superb hotel, and Kuoni a first class business to work with."
Emma Gant (Destination Expert) has been superb. Nothing seems too much trouble and she seems to know the islands / hotels inside out. This will be a recurring theme through out this survey. Excellent customer service.
"Emma was friendly and knowledgable, found us the perfect spot"
"Eve was our contact and was very, very helpful in suggesting different flights and hotels for our trip of a lifetime to New Zealand."
Eve was patient and dealt with our many questions professionally
Every experience we have had with the Kuoni team has been excellent and we wouldn't look elsewhere.
Every member of your team was very helpful
Every part of the experience form initial quotation through to final transfer worked well and there was always a message saying what was due to come up next.
"Everyone was fabulous, no question we asked were ignored.  I will be recommending Kuoni to all my friends.<br/>First time we have used you as we usually do our travel all independently but your knowledge and comments have been so useful.<br/>Look forward to travelling with you often"
"Everyone we dealt with was friendly. But we had several issues along the way, and a big issues whilst on holiday aroynd room reservations which were down to Kuoni and not dealt with."
"Everything from start to finish was amazing an so easy to follow instructions, brilliantly tailor made by josie."
Everything in the UK was excellent. At the airport we didn’t see the Kuoni representative so did not receive our welcome letter however we were subsequently contacted in resort by telephone and WhatsApp
"Everything on the trip went to plan, no hitches!"
Everything that was promised was delivered. All the travel arrangements worked.
Everything was handled professionally - unfortunately we had to cancel this trip back in 2020 and Kuoni refunded all our money with no questions asked - so was extremely happy to be able to rebook our trip!
Everything was incredible. The only reason I wouldn’t give 10 was purely due to the first hotel.  I wouldn’t go back there as it wasn’t the best.
Everything was made quite easy
"Everything was organised for us, at no point did we have to ask a question or check anything prior to or on the holiday."
"Everything worked perfectly and all contact was timely, informative, helpful & efficient"
Excellent advice
Excellent and friendly staff
"Excellent assistance with planning our holiday, I can’t think how it could have been improved"
Excellent communication. Easy to follow instructions. Extremely helpful.
"Excellent customer experience provided by Donna. The only watch out for me, is checking the hotel out for yourself. One of the hotels recommended was only 3 star, according to feedback on Trustpilot due to the standard of rooms. I would not have expected this kind of recommendation."
Excellent customer focus and real enthusiasm to make sure our wishes were catered for. Great follow up and communication.
Excellent customer service
Excellent customer service and choice of trips
Excellent customer service and follow through.
Excellent customer service and I would recommend them again
"Excellent customer service from beginning to end from Michael Leech. He was friendly, knowledgeable and extremely helpful when it came to advice and recommendations. Made booking our dream holiday that much easier and stress free!"
"Excellent for a tailor made holiday, especially when you know roughly what you want. Good advice given at enquirey stage. Possibly rather too expensive for some people."
Excellent friendly and helpful staff in Peter Jones. Nothing too much trouble. 10/10 for Matt.
Excellent friendly and informed service
Excellent friendly and knowledgeable advice from Gemma Hyndman when booking our Hong Kong & Vietnam trip. We needed to explore different dates/flights and Gemma was  prompt and very helpful in getting back to us. Very much looking forward to the trip.
Excellent friendly and knowledgeable service. Always met their own deadlines and kept me informed. Wide range of options.
Excellent friendly knowledgeable staff. Megan was delightful so pleasant and helpful. Lovely welcoming atmosphere. Glass of Champagne was a very nice touch. Exceptional service all round.

Excellent service as always from Sam
Excellent service at exploration and booking phase. It made a real difference speaking to someone who knew the destination and accommodation well.
excellent service both here and abroad cannot fault Kuoni at all. Always there to answer any questions and very helpful.
Excellent service but prices are now not competative. Would pay a slight premium but not 20% more than other operators.
Excellent service by a travel advisor who saw to my every need
Excellent service from Bekki...who looks at all the options and prices!!
"Excellent service from friendly, helpful and extremely knowledgeable staff."
Excellent service from helping plan and book the journey. Plus support while we were there. Special thanks to Zoe at the Sheffield Meadowhall branch who was excellent throughout.
Excellent service from Katie Gosden in the Southampton branch.
"Excellent service from Mino, the Kuoni rep, who helped us when we needed it. (and we did need help)<br/>He contacted us the first evening to ask if we were ok and quickly arranged for us to change rooms. He also put us in touch with an excellent member of staff (Flora) who gave us lots of information about the hotel and Amalfi and a lovely room with a sea view (which we were expecting)"

Excellentninformed interested and competent staff member
"Exceptional holiday , seamless and great hotel picks. We will be booking again , thank you"
exceptional service from Mayur and Pam. Incredibly knowledgeable and great communication
Expected good service from Kuoni
Extremely helpful agent who investigated my request and provided very useful information back to me.
"Extremely helpful and caring staff, nothing is too much trouble"
Extremely helpful and very useful to speak to someone with so much knowledge about the various destinations.
Extremely helpful and welcoming and very patient until we decided on a booking
Extremely helpful designing a honeymoon trip.  Several different destinations and some wonderful accommodation suggestions.  Highly recommended and would definitely choose Kuoni again.
Extremely helpful.  patient with looking at options and providing quotes and great advice.
Extremely helpful. Good knowledge of chosen destinations
Fabulous holiday. Lovely service in Bluewater when we booked it. Amazing hotel and staff. Could not have wished for more
Fabulous service
Fantastic friendly service and very knowledgeable about where we going and how we could personalise it.
Fantastic help and advice from Richard in Nottingham.
Fantastic service
"Fantastic service provided by Winnie, really listened to our key specifications to provide tailored advice on which hotels to visit for our honeymoon and remained flexible whilst we refined our search."
Fantastic service with Faye! Great communication post booking and really looking forward to going abroad and working with her in the future for future holidays!
"Fantastic service, amazing holiday, loved it!"
"fantastic, laura sorted it all out for us over email as we couldn't get to store easily with new born"
Fast and personalized service
Fast response and attention to detail
Feedback from your agent ( Alix ) was swift & what I wanted
"Find the company to be well organised, knowledgeable and very helpful"
"First rate service. Excellent standard of hotels. Lots of useful information. Dealt with requests for changes, upgrades, etc quickly and efficiently. Friendly and helpful throughout."
"First telephone contact after leaving a message online was extremely short, Kuoni not really understanding what we would like. Eventually we settled on an itinerary suggested by ourselves. The numerous iterations of the itinerary (in order to stay within our set budget) seemed to randomly revert back to previous settings (7 nights instead of 6). We nearly did not book as I was getting fed up with having to scrutinise each detail over and over again. 
We were not happy with an early flight time that the Kuoni representative insisted was the only option. In order to avoid this early flight we decided cut our city break short to be informed that later flights are available after all!
When we finally came to book we found out that if we wanted guaranteed seats together as a family on our long haul flights we should use advanced seat selection which will cost extra taking us over budget.
Conclusion: This is the first time and most likely last time we will use a travel agent"
"First time using Kuoni, a friend had used them on their honeymoon so as I am looking for retirement year special holiday I booked an appointment. 

I liked the website offer of a glass
of  champagne whilst discussing potential holiday.  We were not  offered this?

Helen did investigate various options for us, we finally settled on a cruise. When confirmation came through holiday was priced Â£1,000 more which was a shock.  Luckily this was an error.  Awaiting revised confirmation."
"Firstly, we had a wonderful holiday and our exuberant, happy return is a great advertisement for the Azores and Kuoni. There are one or two details which could be improved on, mainly in the planning, but our trip overall remains a very happy memory of a great break."
Friendly and knowledgeable agent.
Friendly experienced and very knowledgeable staff. Nothing was too much trouble and we’ll looked after in the time we were there
Friendly helpful professional service. Easy to get hold of via the phone.
Friendly staff. In particular Bekki Turner who helped us immensely and put together our holiday package. No complaints and we were really happy with the experience. Would recommend Kuoni to anyone.
"Friendly, consistent and excellent source of advice , often based on personal experience."
"From arrival at both airports, we were welcomed and treated extremely well, hotels both great, airport transfers were brilliant, especially the last one coming home."
From arrival at the airport all the way to departure I felt safe in the knowledge Kuoni were with me
From arrival at the store Megan was welcoming and friendly. She was keen to know what we wanted from the holiday rather than just selling us what she thought was best. She had first hand knowledge of our destination and offered suggestions but didnâ€™t make us feel pressured in any way. We felt like the Kuoni staff in Liverpool really listened to what we were looking for and took care of us very well! We feel very confident that we are going to have a fabulous holiday to celebrate our big anniversary
From booking to arriving home the whole holiday was really well organised
"From first phone call to booking confirmation Carolyn at Kuoni made everything so easy. Nothing was too much trouble even when I muddled up all the dates, and changed the order of the visits we wanted to make. All changes were made quickly (presumably thanks to an efficient IT system) and the price was competitive."

"From start to finish the assistance, knowledge and commitment was second to none. Thank you for all your help."
From start to finish the holiday was amazing
From start to finish we had a fabulous trip. Everything worked perfect. Thank you to Kuoni Chelmsford.
"From the first contact to present, Kuoni have been the best we've ever dealt with.  No one better to trust for our holiday of a lifetime!"
From the initial moment we walked through the door at Meadowhall and met Zoe with know idea of where we wanted to go through to getting home from our holiday the whole experience has been amazing and we couldn’t thank or recommend Zoe or Kuoni enough
From the minute we walked into the agent to book everything was so well organised.
"From the moment sat in the shop looking for a holiday to the day we came home it’s been fantastic, such a great company"
"Further research into clients situation, requirements, resort/hotel offerings"
Gareth was extremely helpful in sorting out a holiday package built around a particular cruise we wanted to go on. He had personal experiences of the airlines and place we wanted to go and he was very efficient in putting together a quote within the day. All excellent.
"Gave a budget,  2 quotes came back  1..100% over other 20% over...weird  flights!!!....plus  had to ring and chase up, as assistant had gone on holiday  for 3 weeks,  and didn't leave info for colleagues."
"Gemma and Kay were amazing, nothing was too much trouble. They answered all our questions in full  (we had  a lot of questions !!! ) and helped us pick our perfect holiday. We would definitely recommend to our friends and family."
"Gemma Dick at the Norwich  branch is absolutely brilliant! So knowledgeable and experienced, I felt completely confident in booking the holiday,"
Gemma understood my needs perfectly and responded in the appropriate way
Georgina from Kuoni is a real asset to the company! She treated us as valued customers and made the booking of our holiday a wonderful experience from our initial contact to finalising the booking. She helped us with a previous holiday booking and was equally as helpful but as a returning customer we wondered if the experience would be as good and it definitely was!
Georgina has looked after our holiday needs and made us feel valued
Given a quote for 6700ish one day <br/>Down to 4700ish the next
Glad we had booked with Kuoni when the other companies were making Covid refunds difficult so very happy to rebook when it was Ok to travel again
Going to book a holiday in store just makes the whole thing an enjoyable experience and all the Kuoni staff juts seem really knowledgeable.
Good advice on the holiday choice and planning of the trip was near perfect
Good communication and service
Good face to face service and follow up communication. After our booking we wanted to upgrade our connecting flight economy seats to ones with extra leg room. Unfortunately we were told Kuoni could not do this once tickets had been issued and we had to contact the Airline directly. It would be better to deal with one rather than two parties.
Good itinerary
Good knowledge and helpful
"Good overall package, 2 of the 3 hotels were good with one more 3 star we felt but excellent transfers from all venues and helpful contacts/drivers."
Good quality hotel’s & excellent customer setvice
Good service
"Good service before the holiday, travel arrangements went well for the msot part and lovely hotel"
Good service but price expensive compared to another well known travel agent
Good service in store and Lauren was very patient with our changing ideas. No problems with documents and we were impressed with the smooth operation of airport transfers.
Good service. Unfortunately unable to find the holiday we wanted.
Good servuce
"Good system of online enquiry and agent response, prompt quote."
Great advice and travel ideas. Really responsive and helpful

Great experience booking our holiday. Sam at Harrogate store took time to make sure we got the holiday we wanted. Would highly recommend.
Great experience booking our holiday. Sam at Harrogate store took time to make sure we got the holiday we wanted. Would highly recommend.
Great experience from start of the booking process to the end.  Experienced team who helped ensure the perfect holiday. Even a last minute request to change our return flight was handled with ease.<br/>Will definitely use again for next year!
Great experience from start to finish
"Great experience from walking into the shop and booking, to the flight home. <br/>Only thing to improve would be that our luggage allowance was showing different amounts on different bits of paperwork. Nobody on the phone could really tell me what my allowance was, the last lady was actually a bit rude. <br/>Worth noting that we booked years ago (Covid delays) and all other interactions with staff were 10/10. Everyone was very helpful, understanding and friendly."
Great experience plenty of knowledge and advice to what we wanted
Great experience when booking and from the reps in country; also really good support from the emergency team when we were victims of BA travelling out.  This was very comforting to know there were people able to help us get sorted.
"Great experience, quick response to my enquiries and extremely knowledgeable"
Great help in choosing holiday but little to communication after that.
Great Holiday everything went well
"Great holiday, really well put together by Sharna McKay at Kuoni Metrocentre."
Great hotel very friendly staff excellent food and wine etc very good services pool room cleanliness etc
Great Knowledge and  guidance
Great link to package organiser....Good to have a named person....Choices made easy....Can't think how to improve!
Great personal service and nothing was too much trouble whilst looking for quotes.
"Great personal service from Sue Eaton at Reading branch.  The customer service people on the main customer service number were awful, never called back, no interest in helping, no knowledge.  The difference between staff in a store and staff on the customer service line was stark"
Great quick and friendly service! We are so excited for our holiday!! Laura planned everything we wanted and it was completely hassle free for us
Great service
Great service and a seamless holiday
Great service and Chelsea Webb did an amazing job organising everything and made our trip special.
"Great service and knowledgeable and friendly staff. 
The glass of bubbly alt goes down well too"
Great service and well put together package except the last transfer due to 3 hour wait we upgraded to the seaplane for the return.
Great service but overall in previous years notices that more often then not  holiday are more expensive with Kuoni
Great service but the prices are very high
Great service from Kelly and so helpful in trying to find us what we were looking for.
"Great service from staff at Kuoni Meadowhall, especially Jennifer Staniforth."
Great service from the start until the finish of our holiday.
Great service provided. Tailored the holiday to exact needs.
"Great service through out the booking stage, very helpful when we were delayed on departure and whilst in resort too"
"Great service, prompt replies, helpful staff."
"Great service, prompt response received"
Great team always very well informed and helpful
Great team always very well informed and helpful
"Great to speak to a true travel expert. Held my hand throughout with suggestions, changing itineraries to suit . We’re off to Bali and Singapore for our 40th wedding anniversary so we wanted something very special"
Had a bad experience on a recent holiday - but Kuoni made sure my next holiday went well.<br/>This holiday I chose my own destination - Kuoni had a my deposit I had to use
Had a fabulous consultation with Andrew at the Trafford Centre store. Quickly picked up our wants and needs and subsequently has proved to be really helpful in responding to requests and changes
"Had quite  few issues with this holiday, ranging from the hotel itself, to the suitability of the B+B booking, out of season."
"Had spoken to a few travel agents Kuoni were far the best,  informative and just so helpful"
"Had to do a lot of chasing, to get information and always had to wait for ages getting through on the phone and never spoke to the same person"
"Hannah at Kuoni was great. Totally professional and catered perfectly to our needs. 
Responses were prompt and took all the hassle away from me. 
I would not hesitate to recommend Hannah or Kuoni (subject to our holiday not being a disaster!) to anyone. 
I will be in contact to use again in the future."
Hannah was brilliant.  I live in the US and she was hugely accommodating as regards contacting me with an eight hour time difference.
Hannah was very helpful.
"Hannah worked really hard to meet the brief and went above and beyond to answer queries and provide alternative options. She responded swiftly and promptly to everything, really impressed. So pleased with the holiday we have booked to Mauritius and looking forward to it already!"
"Hannah Wright was exceptional, taking the time to listen, understand and recommend with real knowledge"
Hannah Wright was very helpful in booking our trip
Hardly any contact by you re our holiday. No brochure sent without request and no luggage labels at all!  No suggestions on trips or activities prior to holiday. Cost increase on rescheduling seemed excessive
Harriette was both customer friendly and helpful
Harry was excellent in dealing with our booking enquiry. He was helpful and informative.
Have booked with Kuoni several times and not been disappointed
Have emailed a full response to Kelly in the Norwich store. Absolutely fantastic thank you
Have you used you before for holidays and had a fantastic service. This time the customer service has been really poor. Took weeks for my on line enquiry to get a follow up call 2 weeks later still no quote or holiday ideas ?
"Having booked holidays with kuoni, the whole process was helpful and friendly.  The holiday was fantastic and we're looking forward to the next one."
"Having just returned from a wonderful holiday booked through Kuoni to Crete I wanted to book through them again for a special birthday celebration next year. 
I knew the hotel that would suit my family and I as a place to stay from previously having looked at the website but also from a recommendation by some friends. 
Sam at Kuoni made it very easy to book the holiday for next April so thank you."
Havnt had a reply to my questions
Help from Kuoni staff was excellent.  Time spent in Pafos airport was bewildering and worrying.  Advice from local rep could help.
"Helped print documents we required, as not everyone has a printer."
Helped us choose an amazing Honeymoon at your Liverpool office. Really knowledgeable and friendly staff
Helpful <br/>Plenty of information on the resort
Helpful and holiday went like a dream
Helpful and informed staff
Helpful and knowledgeable staff make the difference which Kuoni have
Helpful and professional
Helpful and quick response
helpful and responsive
Helpful knowledgeable and friendly
"Helpful sales team , Very good communication througout the process"
"Helpful staff, although it did take a long time to pin down the holiday we wanted that wasn't coming up at around £40K!"
Helpful understanding listened
"Helpful, and welcoming staff. Lots of information and advice was provided by all staff members to enable us to make our final choices"
"Helpful, friendly and flexible, particularly Bluewater branch"
"Helpful, knowledgeable and professional staff."
Holiday efficiently arranged with clear detail as to the expectations. we were pleasantly surprised when representatives appeared to help us through airport transitions on flight from Antigua to Barbados.
Holiday expensive compared to identical packages elsewhere
"Holiday ran smooth for the most part, the accomodation and the drivers were a very high standard. Kuoni made some poor decisions however that had to potential to ruin a holiday."
"Holiday was excellent, hotel was good and we had a great time!"
"hotel and transfers excellent flight on way out delayed, and flight on return cancelled and then rearranged at a much later time to heathrow instead of gatwick where our car was, no help offered or provide to get back to our car"
"I admit I have not used Kuoni for a number of years as I thought the prices were higher than other agents. When I saw Facebook adverts for Kuoni  which immediately wants to set up direct contact with an agent further made me believe that it was more bespoke and likely expensive. <br/>When I couldn't find availability for the destination I wanted I decided to contact Kuoni and was put in touch with Bekki Turner (Manchester). She was prompt, efficient, really helpful and it was an utter pleasure to receive such helpful personal service."
"I am an agent and I always pop to the store (phone) for all my bookings, love dealing with Donna and Steve"
I am still awaiting feedback from the honeymoon we just had in which our hotel closed midway through and we were not informed they would literally be taking everything down around us.
I am waiting for June to discuss my options for next yr and tour guildford representative is calling me then.
"I came in on spec so appreciate the time they gave me to find a quote. However, when we looked into the quote a bit more closely we found out that the transfers were not feasible - something we could have easily missed."
I cannot think of any improvements to the service I received from Mr Steve Yates here in the UK and the follow on service from your reps in The Maldives.  Fantastic thankyou.
"I dealt with Richard Harris Nottingham branch. He was friendly, knowledgeable and so accommodating, he listened to my wish list / ideas then produced an itinerary that is amazing and ticked every box I’d mused over!"
"I did a lot of research myself before booking. We knew where we wanted to stay and which flights. I wanted to book with a person rather than an online booking company. Kuoni were £10,064 more than the nearest other company. I rang the Meadowhall store who price matched. It’s a shame there was such a £ difference."
"I didn’t get the quote or the service I expected from Kuoni . I was looking for a holiday package to India and Sri Lanka , I gave a clear brief and still didn’t get what I asked for . I even let you know the time table for my decision making process and you failed to deliver . I have now booked with TrailFinders but am very disappointed that as you were my preferred supplier you couldn’t deliver .. you’ve lost a £26,000 sale !"
i don’t  really do recommendations
I don’t make recommendations
"I don't know if it is just my experience as I have made a connection wit your Harrogate branch, despite living in Buckinghamshire, but I love the fact that your guys seems to really care what kind of holiday I have and are always pleased to help me with any enquiry, you're a big company but it feels personal"
"I felt that I had spoken to or emailed many different people at Kuoni, but never the same person twice.  The night before we left an email said that someone would contact us a few days before we left..... I felt that no one was really in control of what was going on."
I found a quote cheaper than yours. X
I found all of the representatives here and at the resort very knowledgable and helpful
I found the customer service exceptional which in todays computer driven world was very refreshing. It was a pleasure to speak to knowledgable staff who seemed to be genuinely interested in helping and providing a great overall experience.
"I had a fantastic experience with Vicky from the Milton Keynes store, however my experience at both the hotel recommended and the Kuoni Rep abroad wasn’t to the same standard."
"I had further question to ask, but the person I was dealing with was not available, that's fine but no automatic take up by another member of staff."
I had initially spoken to one person who was very polite and asked questions and then I was passed over to another. Who sent a quote for 3k above my original budget. I then emailed back to say it was too high above the initial budget and I've heard nothing back. <br/>
"I have always like Kuoni having used them before to travel to the Caribbean. Scott whom has been looking into my holiday plans for next year has been really good, i haven't got the full details yet but he has kept me in the loop and when i've spoken to him he clearly knows what he talking about."
"I have been a Kuoni client for 40 years and would normally travel with you, long haul. This particular enquiry was for a trip to Cyprus and other operators dealing mainly with Europe had a wider choice."
I have found your customer service to be second to none.  Nothing too much trouble.
"I have never had to make an appointment to book a holiday before with Kuoni, we came back into the shop 1.5 hours later and our enquiry took less than 10 minutes, the cost was £800.00 more than your competitors down the road, we asked if you price matched (we asked for your best price as I do not like to waste time going through the rigmarole of discounts etc) but was told there was no one to price match, we were asked to e-mail our quote from Trailfinders on Monday in order for the girl to forward to your price match department, why she couldn’t photo copy the quote I don’t know, we left the shop more than disappointed and went straight back to Trailfinders and booked the holiday there and then.<br/>I don’t know if it was having the best experience from Kuoni Leicester in the past, but our Solihull experience fell well short."
I have recently dealt with Josie Doe and she has been amazing person. Apologies that we have not actually booked any trips yet due to our personal circumstances and also this recent quote has come out very expensive so we have decided not to progress with that trip. But the best thing about kuoni is Josie has always been there to assist us. Hence I keep coming back and hopefully we will book something with you soon. We have traveled with Kuoni often and I can’t fault your services.
"I have used Kuoni for my long haul holidays for many years now and can’t recommend them enough.  I love the personal service, having a named contact, and that you can easily get to speak to a real person quickly, and that then staff  have experienced the holidays themselves so are in a great place to provide first rate advice/ information."
I particularly liked the personal service of phoning me at a given time.
I received all of the information that I needed with some useful insights to help me decide.
I received no response to my enquiry....
I received no response to my enquiry....
"I spoke initially to an agent but did not receive the information requested however when I returned I deal with Kirsty who apologies and sent a prompt, considered and detailed proposal. She was very professional and friendly."
I still have not received anything back from Kouni regarding may request for a tour of India which was requested on Friday 31 March.
I think the cost is higher than necessary and the response from advisers is quite slow.
I wanted a brochure to take away and read up on a particularly country that I am interested in visiting next year for the first time. Advisor just wanted to get a sale there and then when I'm not yet ready to book.
I was anxious to make my river cruise booking for 2024 because it had just been released. I was very pleased with the consistency high service given at Kuoni Peter Jones.
"I was at the airport waiting for the outward flight and received an email telling me my itinerary has changed.  It asked me to check my new itinerary carefully.  There is no way to check my itinerary as my itinerary was sent to me via email in the first place.  <br/>In the email, there was no information for what has changed.  Then I telephoned and emailed Maxine for further information.   She replied to me quickly and result the issue.  Apparently there was 5 minutes delay in my return flight!  Imagine Maxine or your office was not available to comments, I would have worried about what has been changed for my whole holiday.<br/><br/>"
I was expecting more advice and options
"I was expecting to pay up to 20% more by booking through Kuoni for the hotel stay that I was looking for. In fact I was quoted £3,400 for a holiday that I could book independently for £2,200. This seemed excessive for flights, hotel and short transfer."
I was met by only 1 representative in Hua Hin who explained everything about transport and places to visit in town. This did not happen in either Chiang Mai or Bangkok. It would have been really helpful in Bangkok
I was pleased with your advisors knowledge of the Maldives and their efficient service.
I was really impressed with the Kuoni service throughout and our holiday was totally seamless.
I was very impressed with the patience shown to me as we worked together to plan a fantastic trip
"I wasnâ€™t sure what I could actually afford and book so when speaking to the lovely lady it was just basically an enquiry, she put me at ease and explained everything and I was so pleased I booked it there and then"
I would definitely recommend Kuoni . It’s a first class service with lovely staff
I would have really loved to have had one of the staff phone my wife or me prior to the holiday rather than JUST an email. Keeping it personal and caring.
I would recommend Kuoni the staff look after you and nothing is too much to find the right holiday .
I would recommend them because they were  very helpful with all my queries and sorted out my holiday very efficiently
"I’m not sure if I would book another holiday through Kuoni again. With this being our honeymoon the start of our holiday didn’t go to plan, the Kuoni staff in the Maldives were rude and weren’t helpful at all."
I’ve been really disappointment to be honest. We used Kuoni for our honeymoon and you guys were great but this time hasn’t been the same. I initially made an enquiry and was told someone would get back to me. I didn’t hear anything and so I called up and was told there was no record of my enquiry. I spoke with Jordan Munn who apologised and said she would sort this. I then received a link to a hotel with a price that was much higher than we discussed. I asked Jordan to put together a few options for us to look at and she said she would. I then received a call from another person yesterday who told me Jordan was now off sick however the hotel she has offered to us wasn’t actually available. I then explained what I had discussed with Jordan and she told me my budget was too low really for what Kuoni offer but she would see what she could do. I have managed to get a quote within budget from another company and have now booked this instead.
"I'M sorry , but all suggestions were far too expensive for us, but thank you your time and courtesy."
In all honestly I do not see the value that Kuoni brought. I ciould have / should have just booked directly with the hotel and airline. Im not sure what it is that Kuoini did for us.
In store experience was first rate. Could have used a call prior to flying and connecting flight details could have been handled better
In store Kuoni rep was excellent.
In the initial stages of booking Malcolm was so knowledgeable and enthusiastic in pulling together an itinerary. When things went horribly wrong at my end Pam went over and above to salvage some of my holiday
Individual tour request with specific travel dates etc all fully incorporated in our our itinerary with excellent accommodation proposals- all accepted and booked as efficiently as we could wish.
"Information for trips planned and paid for in advance were not available when we left for our trip.  It is important that all information is checked and followed up before client departure.<br/>More research by your staff is required - our holiday was originally planned by your staff with a visit to Antigua before St.Lucia.  That meant we were travelling in a direction which was not logical.  When I researched this and discovered the additional expense of the direction of travel, this was changed by your agent."
Information on travelling to the Maldives should have a quick check list at the start and also include the requirement to register with Maldives Immigration
"Initial booking experience was great, lots of advice provided and we were very happy. After this however we received little to no communications and were pretty much left to our own devices (we typically have better communications and documentation from high street travel agents such as TUI).<br/><br/>This was a honeymoon booking and important information such as sea plane baggage allowances were buried on page 12 of the documents provided, as such they were missed and we had to pay $80 on arrival to the seaplane terminal (though we were within the main airlines limits comfortably).<br/><br/>Finally we were meant to have 5 nights in our final hotel yet we only actually had 4 as the flight home was 1am, we should have been offered a late checkout instead and not charged for 5 nights."
"Initially excellent service but then was passed from pillar to post and seemed to have someone different deal with me each time. It was as if once I'd paid, the agents were no longer interested in me."
Initially the help I received was great. But then when I wanted to go ahead and book I found out that the lady had left kuoni with no ooo and around 2 weeks later I received an email from<br/>A colleague to say she had left. I’ve already booked elsewhere now
It has been a number of years since we had used Kuoni and pleased to see that the service is still top notch!
It is so good to deal with someone (Maxine) who knows the resort and is able to giver personal advice. She was very patient with us and gave us loads of choice.
It was a challenging trip sadly it didn’t start well with our bag being stolen with all my wife’s personal items in it. We also need to speak to you about a couple of points. The hire car was a poor decision as we had to pay £20 per night in the hotels and Rome wouldn’t allow it so we cancelled that part of the trip. As a result we ended up with way more costs. The advice on getting a new passport in Florence ended up being incorrect which used up another three quarters of a day. All could have been avoid if planned better at the start. I’m happy to discuss these points. The last five days rained in Serento which couldn’t be avoided but the eight hour drive there could have been lessened due to the cycle race. My mobile number is +447798802195. Thank you. Mark
"It was a very good experience booking my holiday. Quick to get through and the travel expert, Chelsea Webb, was very friendly, helpful and informative."
"It was a very good holiday and we would definitely do another. So many highlights. But also a few of areas that could have been better. The transfer from amboseli to Mombasa was only about 200 miles point to point but took us from 8am to 11pm using a whole day. We were driven for 6 hours back to Nairobi then had to wait 6.5 hours at the airport (the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours) eventually arriving at our Mombasa hotel 15 hours after we left amboseli. It clearly would have been much better if we had been driven directly from amboseli to Mombasa instead of being taken back to Nairobi for a flight. Also there was no need to leave amboseli at 8am as even without the flight delay we would have arrived 5 hours before our flight. If we had left a couple of hours later this would have allowed us to relax at Amboseli a bit longer, avoiding a rushed early departure and still allowed plenty of time at the airport.  The other issue we had was we had to pay for our last lunch at the Mombasa hotel despite being full board. We had 4 nights full board  so would have expected 4 lunches included but we only had 3. Finally our pickup from Mombasa never turned up. We had to get the hotel to contact the pickup company to sort this out. As a result we left the hotel about 50mins later than we should have. <br/>"
it was all very good but as it was all sent to my email i could have booked online and saved a trip to the shop just to book
"It was great that Kuoni took care of everything and the communication up until the holiday was very good. However, the transfer information on our travel itinerary said that the hotel or is ourselves would be contacted re transfers to the airport but this was not the case and so we had a bit of stress trying to find out what time we would be picked up from the hotel. <br/>Our travel itinerary also said that once we arrived Phuket we should exit through exit 3 & 4 and that someone would be waiting with a sign with our names on, exit 3 & 4 no longer exist and we we ended up walking around the whole outside of the airport with our heavy suitcases to try and find our transfer. <br/>Lastly, we were away on honeymoon and the hotel in Thailand did not know we were in our honeymoon. Our travel itinerary said that we were getting a couple of added extras - spa treatment and 3 course meal but the hotel knew nothing about this and either did the Kuoni rep at the hotel. <br/>We had a great time though, just a few things that went wrong."
It wasnâ€™t a straight forward booking but staff found a way of sorting it and responded very quickly.
It will be great if you have transfer from home to airport even if optional.
"It would have been helpful to have more details on luggage allowance and plans or to be given the options to change fare types as I had to check my hand luggage in for 2 internal US flights and pay an extra $45 each time to do so.  We were aware there would be a charge for the main cases, but also the allowed weight was different from our trans Atlantic flight which was a little frustrating."
It’s all good. Loved the resort
It’s been great.  Would have been a 10 but there was a mix up with flights somehow got changed to a different day and went unnoticed.  I happened to notice 3 weeks prior to flying.  Was all sorted and we had an extra night added on at no cost to us.  So worked ok for us but I was slight panicked when I realised we were flying home a different date and were short of one nights accommodation.
Jaime goes above and beyond to make sure your holiday exceeds expectations. We have been booking our holidays with Jaime for over 4 years and would trust no one else to make our holidays so special. We have booked some milestones holidays in the last year and Jaime took so much care and attention with each one and we could not have wished for more. Jaime is a huge asset to Kuoni.
"Jaime has been excellent helping us plan our 2024 holiday. We live in Portugal, but communication has been great."
Jaime was friendly & knowledgable & made our booking experience stress free. Would definitely use the Chelmsford office sgsin.
"James from Cambridge branch was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable."
"James, the consultant who has been assisting us, was very accomodating and agreed to put together 2 different proposals (we couldn't decide between two destinations) and has kept us updated at every stage. He really listened to our requirements and wishlist.<br/>Perhaps a wider variety of hotels in some destinations would be good."
Jamie was extremely helpful and we have booked with Kuoni in the past. Very impressive
Jared at your Norwich branch was patient beyond belief. He had to do lots of towing and froing to finally  get us the holiday of our dreams. A real pleasure to have someone who listened to what we were looking for.
Jared put together a very good itinerary that covered everything that I asked for.
Jessica and the whole holiday was amazing from start to finish
Jessica was enthusiastic and not put off by the fact we didn't have a clear idea of where we wanted to go. She managed to tailor a holiday and fulfil our wishes.
Jessica was so friendly and excelled at her job
Jessica was so helpful & provided great customer service
Jessica was very informative and definitely knew her stuff!
"Jo at Chichester was fantastic, very helpful, we will definitely be back to book our next one,"
"Joanne was extremely helpful,  but unfortunately the quotation was too<br/>Expensive - cheaper quote elsewhere. <br/>"
Josie was able to give us different suggestions based on what we wanted and took the time to present the different options in terms of travel times and prices. She even adjusted these a couple of times over the course of a few days. They were able to find something that suited our dates and were cheaper than Trailfinders. They followed up with further information following booking. A really good experience.
Josie was knowledgeable and professional.
Josie was so kind and helpful
"Julie (John Lewis, Cribbs) was extremely knowledgeable and helpful."
"Julie was knowledgable , helpful , patient and efficient. I felt confident I was booking the right holiday."
Just a quality service provided.
"Justine was fantastic, very helpful. Great service."
Karen was extremely helpful and we greatly appreciated the advise we received
Karen was fantastic. We explained when we wanted to go and our ideal holiday. She took the time to listen and then come back with a variety of great recommendations. Between us we whittled it down and are now looking forward to our amazing trip.
"Karen was very helpful in describing types of holiday at destinations we were unfamiliar with and then homing in on appropriate resorts for our requirements. Quotes were received promptly, were not competitive but Karen and Marie worked hard to improve the quote. In the event they were limited as to what they could do at a weekend and we booked elsewhere."

"Karen, Sue and Stephen were so helpful in Kuoni Reading. Nothing was an issue and they went out of their way to ensure we had the best trip for our honeymoon."
"Katie was lovely, so knowledgable and really listened to what we wanted for our honeymoon. Amazing service and would highly recommend."
Katie was very helpful and willing to have a chat with us before her next appt arrived. She found several options for us to consider.
Kay Cross at Norwich branch happy to discuss holiday options with me when I turned up at branch with no appointment. Her knowledge far exceeded what I had been able to pick up from your online service
"Keep coming back to kuoni as they get it right first time every time, they understand the person therefore match the vacation to your preference and expectation."
Keep up the good work
Kelly at kuoni chichester was amazing and very helpful with the whole holiday process.
"Kelly Ruth is polite, friendly, knowledgeable, professional and extremely helpful."
Kelly was very helpful and we found my perfect short break with a bit of looking.
Kerry at Manchester absolutely fab xxx
Kerry Wight was phenomenal. She listened to what we enjoyed and wanted in a honeymoon and was able to come up with suggestions and places we had never thought of. She tailor made our dream holiday and was so patient changing things as the holiday took shape. I'd recommend kuoni in a heartbeat.
Kirsty at Solihull branch gave us excellent service and advice.
knowledgeable and approachable service
Knowledgeable and helpful representative  who made us feel special throughout the booking process.
Knowledgeable and very friendly service. We felt well looked after and unhurried.
"Knowledgeable, friendly, accessible by phone."
"Knowledgeable, good choices and recommendations."
Kuoni always give a 1st class service  and have used them for many years now and i do recommend them to my friends too.
Kuoni always provide the perfect getaway
Kuoni are consistently perfect
Kuoni are really helpful and provide useful information quickly to help you decide on your holiday plans.
"Kuoni could do with a bit of price transparency, especially when booking twin centres. It would be good to know how much the excursions were and what's included - we didnt realise lunch would be included for some excursions, thank goodness we didnt opt for the full board option for our hotels. <br/><br/>We felt that it was good that we had access to the local representatives and be able to reach out to them but we felt the frequency of their contact was too excessive given the length of stay. All we need is to know who they are and how to contact them. For example, the first local representative (Gehan) did very well.  Local Reps need to be mindful that we are there to relax and enjoy our time, not worry if we've missed their call almost every other day. We think it's borderline disruptive for both us and the hotels' staff."
Kuoni has a good reputation. Agents knowledge and support is excellent.
Kuoni have a good record on delivery and try to ensure that their customers get the best experience.
Kuoni have always been first class with everything to do with booking holidays
Kuoni have been brilliant to deal with. They are all very knowledgeable and the customer service was great
"Kuoni is not really well known amongst  people on a budget, therefore I would be careful about how much detail I discuss with family and friends."
Kuoni is very expensive in comparison with other travel agents although Charlotte was very helpful.
"Kuoni rep found me a perfect holiday even though I was asking for late availability, super helpful and professional and friendly. Always a pleasure to deal with Kuoni."
Kuoni rep really would be nice to actually see them at some point - I think they should visit the islands on one day so you have a face to meet as often our phones were in the safe.
Kuoni was very good the customer service was excellent
Kuoni were brilliant from start to finish. I'd like to particularly give a shout out to Sofia; she kept in contact with me from the moment of booking to departure. She was always quick to respond to emails and answer all my queries - none were too silly - and and adjusted our holiday to suit us perfectly.
"kuoni were very helpful ,accommodating and knowledgible."
Lack of knowledge in the sales shop use of out of date hotels incorrect information about trips
Laura Garfitt has been great
"Laura was very professional, friendly and helpful."
"Life has taken over and we go on holiday for 2 weeks this weekend, but we will be discussing the quote and advice and be back.  Thank you"
Linda and Michael were both excellent!
Lindsey was very understanding and gave us a great insight to the holiday.
Listened to my requirements and sourced what I was looking for. Very patient and swift to reply to emails and many questions.
Listened to our requests and found the ideal holiday to forefill them.
Listened to our requests and found the ideal holiday to forefill them.
Little added value. Huge issues with hotels not finding our booking or displaying the wrong room preferences. Never again!
Live chat was excellent probably the best I have used.<br/>Excellent chat and follow up
"Logistics during the actual trip I was pleased with, the drivers and the organisation with our flight changes. However getting to this point was incredible disappointing. We had been told, and charged, for event tickets we were told you could provide that then never materialled and the waiting meant we missed our change to get them ourselves. Our main contract new how important this was for us, changing our flights just so we could make it. Our original conformation itinerary included ski hire and ski pass for which was then later omitted from our final paid for itinerary, with no communication,  resulting in us on the first day of our honeymoon waiting around to find out what had happened. Then the biggest of all was a number of errors in a row just 2 weeks before our wedding and honeymoon. We were told our traditional half hours accommodation was incorrectly booked and we had no where for our last night, as a result they recommended a change in accommodation. Later to find out it was now just accommodation and not half board (significant change to our traditional Japanese stay). Later to find out that now we could not only stay at this new incorrect accommodation as it was unsafe and hence cancelled, and our original booking was gone so offered a hotel (not half board, not a traditional home stay), in a completely different city. All this only a couple of weeks before we leave! No compensation or way of resolving this as a professional holiday provider, we found the perfect place to stay ourselves. Made me wonder why we used a travel company and didn't just do it ourselves"
Looked into what we required into for our holiday and gave us the perfect advice as to what was best to suit our needs. The experience and expertise of which the people whom we spoke to was exactly what we needed to book the perfect trip.
Love the personal touch
Loved our holiday & all the Kuoni staff uk and Maldives side were great! Especially Angelo who welcomed us at the resort! Great service and very approachable and relaxed way of infoing us of everything!
"Lovely experience with Claire, she was very knowledgeable regarding our destinations and assisted putting a great package together for us for our November vacation"
"Lovely experience with Claire, she was very knowledgeable regarding our destinations and assisted putting a great package together for us for our November vacation"
Lovely holiday<br/>Would recommend that a few of the hotels we stayed in in Sri Lanka we felt were lower budget type and not at the standard we expected unlike the others we stayed at
Lovely Lucy and her team greeted me each time in a very warm and friendly welcoming manner and addressed all my queries with patience.
"Lovely visit to store, engaged and listened to our ideas, worked with us on the different options"
Lower prices
"Made very welcome at the Bluewater branch, with a cup of tea as we discussed our holiday plans with Josie. Made us feel at ease and under no pressure to book a holiday on the spot like many of the holiday sales shops.
Josie took our plans and is currently working on putting together our holiday. 
We keep in touch via email."

Make the store less echoey and loud...struggled to hear what we were looking at with our rep as others were talking in the store and the sound was overwhelming.
Marie was amazing in helping us choose the perfect honeymoon ! We loved every minute and would 100% recommend to anyone else
Mary Janiec knew we were interested in a specific cruise and she told us about a special offer. Kirsty Faulks booked it for us very quickly.
Matt was so knowledgeable and spent lots of time explaining all our options to us!
Maxine was amazing. So patient with us doing multiple quotes till we found a fantastic holiday.
"Megan was really helpful, she provided us with a variety of options and helped us plan a honeymoon of a lifetime!"
Melanie was extremely knowledgable about the area we wished to visit offering lots of advice. Excellent after sales service too.
"Melissa Fritchley booked our holiday to Mauritius and provided amazing service from start to finish and has regularly stayed in contact.<br/><br/>The holiday itself was beyond our expectations , and we can highly recommend Paradise Cove, absolutely 10 out of 10 on everything, we loved the island and the hotel.<br/><br/>Transfers to and from hotel and meet and greet at airport all perfect, can’t knock anything other than next time we’d definitely look at upgrading from economy for such a long flight. <br/><br/>Thank you :)"
Melissa has helped us find fantastic holiday destinations more than once. We were thrilled when we visited our Kuoni store to find Melissa working that day and we realised we would have first class advice and care again!
Mellisa Hayward was excellent in helping us plan our holiday
Met my expectations. The lady I saw was very helpful
"Michael provided amazing service from the moment we entered the store, right through to communicating via email to the point booking. He was patient, listened, answered multiple questions and he understood our needs for our honeymoon. He offered honest advice regarding his own travels and came up with an amazing honeymoon package for us! We canâ€™t wait!"
Michael provided excellent service
Michael was amazing to work with booking this holiday and totally understood our needs
"Michael was incredibly helpful, he took the time to understand the main things that were important to me when choosing a resort, went through some key questions to make sure I understood some if the main differences and came back with some really great options within budget. He then took time to further refine these when I came back with more questions and needing to change dates really quickly."
"Michelle was amazing, thankyou for helping us with our dream family holiday."
Might be out of some price range
More expensive than same holiday with another provider
"More transfer info at Male, it was a bit confusing."
"Most helpful, kind, patient and totally efficient. I canâ€™t thank them enough. So impressed. Thank you.  John"
Most of our friends could not afford Kuoni hols
"Must helpful, with tips and knowledge of the hotels and areas"
"My advisor was fabulous, very knowledgeable and always available to answer any questions"
My dream holiday was made into reality thanks to Charlotte
"My fiancÃ© and I recently booked our Honeymoon to Hurghada, Egypt with Kuoni. We went in store to Kuoni, John Lewis, Chelmsford and were warmly greeted by Stacey Warley, the Store Manager. We'd popped in on the off chance they could help as we were becoming overwhelmed with choice from using multiple websites and apps to search. Stacey quickly sat us down and got lots of information from us in order to find the best offers. She showed us two quotes for places we were interested in going to, and was able to talk us through our options. We were able to book our Honeymoon there and then, with an amazing hotel that had everything we wanted, that was still way within our budget. Stacey then supported us with looking at options on the flights and explaining all the information we needed for our trip. We even got a complimentary glass of champagne to celebrate whilst everything was booked. If you're in a similar situation to us, we'd definitely recommend taking a trip to Kuoni and seeing what they can do for you!"
My Kuoni expert was Hannah and she was a godsend. She was able to find me the destination of my dreams. I want to commend Hannah for her patience and helpfulness. I had a plethora of questions and she was always willing to help me and answer them. Honestly 5 star service.
"My one area of feedback is the first hotel we stayed in (Handlery Union Square). The hotel was in quite a dangerous area of San Francisco (right next to the Tenderloin district) and this impacted our experience. On top of this, the hotel felt quite dated (pictures didn’t reflect this). I wouldn’t recommend sending people to downtown San Francisco"
My parents have now booked for next year after hearing my rave reviews
My point of contact from start to finish was Catrina Henderson and she was just perfect in the way she explained and detailed everything I needed to no .
My wife and I had a relaxing holiday in Cyprus. It was exactly what we were expecting.
N/A

"Name spelt incorrectly, causing airline booking issues only resolved by ourselves. Hotel, which we did choose, incorrectly booked room not as requested. Took third room before anything remotely acceptable was offered. Toronto Chelsea Hotel has gone downhill in the intervening years since our last visit and I do not think it matches your requirements for recommending to travelers."
Needed more up to date on problems which effected our holiday
Neil Kemble has been very helpful  in suggesting various options for a holiday during christmas
Neil was very helpful and knowledgeable in finding us the right holiday for our honeymoon.
"Never answered queries, completely overpriced for what they offer - to the point where it just takes the mick! They are at least double the price of identical holidays"
"Nicola has been fab so far, really friendly and helpful!"
"Nicola was friendly and welcoming and took time to understand our requirements and was able to advise us, using her wealth of knowledge and experience."
Nicola was really helpful in providing all the options and suggestions
No issues at all
"No longer a local branch to go into (Kingston, Middlesex) and email was slow and calls not as personable as being able to go into our local Tui shop"
No pressure but explained everything we wanted to know. Was aware of money constraints and she worked hard to find the best deals for us.
No quotation
"No visa , no reminder from kuoni we needed one <br/>Very poor customer service from shop we booked with <br/>Big shout out to Paula Smith for saving our holiday and helping us only missing one day"
None- we are very satisfied.
"None, practically perfect."
"Noone called me back, and I was going to book a holiday"
Not 10 as some advice provided about travel / destination was found to be incorrect on arrival.
"not a nasty 3, rather such frustration. i called your sales team and gave them all the information to allow then to recommend me a holiday to canada. told them i wasnt shopping around and only calling kuoni. it seemed the perfect holiday to me. i gave flexibility on price and departure dates and essentially said....bring me something close to this and ill book it.<br/>i understood it would take a few days to put a plan together and that was fine.<br/>clearly something was registered and i left my phone number......and that until the survey was the last i heard.<br/>stuff has got in the way at my end so the offer to find me a holiday still stands if anyone there can help.  kieran salter"
Not all my family and friends can afford similar holidays so the question is only partially relevant.
Not as wide aspread of options as I was expecting.
Not really at all what I asked for
"Not sure how<br/>Only negative war the infestation of mosquitoes we came in 2019 and had no issues. In May 23 the amount of bites we suffered was unbelievable, looking at other guests this seems a common problem, other than that fantastic"
Not sure there's anything you could do to improve the service we get from Alex and the team at your King Street Manchester branch!
"Not very helpful, had to chase for answers, not friendly at all - have had a better experience from Ramsay Travel and Barrhead Travel in Aberdeen."
Nothing
nothing comes to mind

Objective advice with expert knowledge and absolutely no pressure
"Oboroi hotel service was excellent, really good however hygiene was not. E.g, Mice in the two restaurants, and bathroom was constantly full of flees."
Offered plenty of choices to meet our requirements. Gave us time to consider. Made small adjustments at our request and confirmed the booking immediately on the phone and then by email.
"Once contacted, very good response, prompt feedback with requesated info and info met exactly our criteria."
Online access to hotel prices would be useful in the early stages of planning.
"Online quotes, instead of emails."
Only issue was timing of transfer to airport and flight home. Ended up waiting at airport for 5 hours. Then on top of that flight was delayed 2 hours. That wasn’t your fault but perhaps being there 2 hours before flight be better.
Only not a 10 because some family/friends may not want to pay too high a price for their holidays
Organisation at the Kuoni office in Edinburgh was excellent. Efficient and informative. The choice of the hotel was excellent too with one or two minor reservations. <br/>The only real issue was the Jet 2 return flight from Corfu. We arrived at the airport 2 hours and 20 minutes before our departure time but there was a queue of over 100 yards of Jet2 passengers waiting outside the departure terminal and it was clear at an early stage that we would not get through check in on time. <br/>Despite many Edinburgh passengers raising concerns- nothing was done until about 30mins before departure time when we were prioritised. Despite this the flight left an hour late and I feel this was entirely due to poor organisation by Jet2 staff on the ground. There were several Jet2 flights due to depart within a few hours and clearly some passengers arrived very early.
"Originally enquired with another high street travel agent who could not provide the required itinerary and thought Kuoni would be too costly. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I made the initial enquiries. The representative returned by call request and was able to provide knowledgeable information regarding my chosen destination. It was obvious that Faye listened to what my holiday plans wanted to include and that I was travelling with my daughter for a special trip. The initial proposal was sent over within a couple of hours and just about ticked every box. Flights were direct and the choice of accommodation perfect for each destination. Follow up discussion resulted in a booking and flights confirmed. Very satisfied with the entire process and enjoyed the conversation regarding trips available, with Faye having travelled to the country personally, and could verify many of my suggestions and alleviate any concerns."
Our experience with Kuoni from start to finish has been very positive and gave us an amazing holiday
"Our flight home was booked with out luggage allowance, thankfully we noticed ahead of time but was an additional cost we were not planning for"
"Our Honeymoon was absolutely fantastic and gave us memories that will last a lifetime. A big part of this is down to Neil Kemble in your Chester store who understood our brief and planned us the most amazing trip. We didn't have a single issue whilst we were there with hotels, flights or transfers and I would recommend Kuoni to anybody looking to book a honeymoon or dream holiday."
"Our Kuoni agent, Vicky Bignell, of Kuoni Milton Keynes, was very helpful with suggestions and options for our honeymoon."
Our Kuoni assistant is fabulous but the other lady in the shop on our second visit I wouldn’t be able to recommend at all. It made us feel very grateful to of met Karen first.
Our original consultant left after booking and then we had several different consultants.
Our rep Mustafa was extremely helpful and any issue that arose he sorted immediately. His presence made us relax as we knew if we had a problem he was on hand to help. He gave us useful information at our welcome meeting which got the holiday off to a good start. We are very appreciative of his help.
Our visit to your representative was very informative. We hope to be in touch with her in the next few days.
Over priced
Overall a great experience but there are a few things you could change. Pepper club is not 5 stars its very tired. We arrived a the franshock hotel too early nothing to do and we couldt get in the room. Journey home was not the best - too long a wait at airport.
Overall excellent holiday
"Overall Kuoni lived up to our expectations, following on from our previous use of the company."
"Overall we felt the experience on our holiday was disappointing. There were a number of things which were misleading when booking. <br/>Firstly the flight seemed to be operated by a subsidiary of British Airways, rather than BA itself, which wasn’t stated on the booking and at no point was this information provided that the flight would be an alternative to British airways. I feel this is an important distinction as it was a very different experience and comfort level than what we have had with BA before, with extremely small leg room and poor service on board. Had we known this we might not have chosen the flight/destination. <br/><br/>When we arrived in Crete there was no car seat provided in the transfer which again is stated on the booking that this would be provided. This meant it was an anxious car ride to the hotel having to hold our daughter on my lap and even though it’s a short journey this was not safe. <br/><br/>The hotel and specifically our room was not what we expected. I think it is a bit misleading to advertise the room as a sea front bungalow. Firstly it was a fair distance back from the beach- not what I would say is ‘sea front’ or ‘suite-to-sea’ as described.<br/>Secondly, I think referring to it as a bungalow gives the impression of more space. The room was really small with a tiny bathroom and no sitting area. The outside space was also very small and it had a footpath running directly in front of it which had heavy footfall meaning there was no privacy and it was not an inviting place to sit. There were also 2 beds pushed together instead of a double bed in the room which wasn’t comfortable at all. The bathroom hooks were coming off the wall and the shower drain was dirty/blocked. Overall it wasn’t a comfortable room for a family. <br/><br/>The hotel itself is not what I would expect from a 4 star premium all inclusive. There were a number of things which didn’t meet our expectations, mainly the standard of service and of the facilities.<br/><br/>The queue for a table at dinner at the main restaurant every night was very long, no matter what time we went.<br/>Once we had a table it was very chaotic getting our food, it was so busy and you had to queue up again for a long time so it was not a relaxing experience. It felt like the hotel is not equipped to handle the number of guests on site. <br/>Also no one checked on us during meals. Simple things were missing from the service like no water brought to table at any meals. It was very much self serve and we were left to our own devices. I would expect a bit more attentive service for a 4 star advertised as ‘premium’<br/>There was also a supplement on a large number of drinks - I would expect some additional drinks such as the wine list and some branded spirits to be at extra charge but not standard cocktails. <br/><br/>There were no tables next to sunloungers for drinks which resulted in plastic cups and other rubbish left on the ground. <br/>Many umbrellas round the pool were broken/difficult to put up and no one was around offering to help.<br/>There were also lots of cats around and they would get quite close to the loungers which wasn’t ideal with our baby. Again no staff seemed to be around to help keep them away. The grass around the heated pool in particular was overgrown and there were lots of weeds and muddy patches. Generally it was quite unkept."
"Overall, a great service.  All our questions were answered in a professional manner and everything went smoothly."
"Overall, we had a fabulous holiday. However, we had a strange experience with our transfer to Grand Hotel Menaggio.  I had contacted our rep Maria the day before to ask for exact details of our transfer. All she said (in her WhatsApp) was that we were expected to make our own way to the local station, because the journey was short. She said nothing about any private transfer at the other end. We spent a while at the train station, unsure about how to get to our next hotel. Had a taxi been waiting for us, I’m sure the driver would have been waiting with our name on a sign, or would have been looking for us. But our paperwork had said “no private transfer,” so although we found that strange and unlikely, we were forced to arrange our own journey. We found a bus going to our hotel, with a journey time similar to that of a taxi, so we boarded a bus, at a cost of approximately 12 euros. During our journey Maria phoned me and asked where we were because a taxi had been waiting ages for us. This was clearly untrue! She should simply have apologised for her mistake and we would have forgiven her, because everyone makes mistakes. Apart from this incident Maria was always available and quite helpful."
"Perfect , very helpful."
Perfect polite humorous
Perhaps could have done with more hands-on rep service in Bangkok and Chang Mai on our holiday - just had a book in room and wattsapp conversations if needed. When arriving in Phuket had a meeting scheduled with our rep second day and were advised what trips etc... to book which was great. <br/>Our transfer didnt turn up on arrival in Bangkok and hadnt been booked for whatever reason so not a great start.<br/>I feel we could have got more out of Bangkok with a rep meeting.
"Person who served us was new, and able to provide little information, and colleague was off hand ,not particularly welcoming. Not the pleasant experience that we were expecting."
"personable, excellent knowledge and nice to engage with someone who had prepared and thought about our holiday"
Personal face-to-face service - freindly whilst very professional. First used Kuoni in 1974 - still as good as they were then.
Personal knowledge of my requirements. Helpful advice on choosing between options.
"Personal service, high standards"
Phoned up and left all info about where I wanted to go and when I went into Kuoni Manchester Becky had all the info for me.
"Planned holidays by Kuoni we would very likely recommend to our family and friends of our age, the younger family and friends would and are capable of getting and planning on line without assistance"
Pleasant and relaxed. Not pushed or hurried.
"Plenty of information supplied in response to my endless questions, patience when I called back several times, professional and efficient"
"Plenty of options based in my requirements
Able to quote different options on the phone
Able to negotiate"
Polite friendly service from a knowledgeable representative who called back exactly at time promised.
Poor after sales communication.  Hotel in Cape Town very noisy due to nearby club and not in good location.  Gluten-free meals not requested on 3 out of 5 flights.
Poor booking experience but great holiday
Poor pre holiday service. Was told we would only get e ticket and no hard copy. Electronic e ticket failed to arrive and with a week to go after I chased it up twice it had to be sent to the Harrogate office and forwarded to us. Magically (after we had gone to the trouble of getting the e ticket printed ) we received a printed copy a few days before we flew. Went to the trouble of checking in online and Qatar Airways discarded our printed boarding passes and issued their own! Went to your Harrogate branch one Saturday when the internet said it was open only to find it closed. The holiday itself was good.
"prefer to research holiday online then call agent if need further help. Kuoni system used to be amazing, booking online all the time and now is non existant. I can't say how without this system deters me from booking with yourselves"
Price was more expensive than BA holidays for the same trip. So booked with BA
Price well over budget. No evidence you attempted to get within budget. Had to sit in office whilst advisor sat on phone to a colleague and provide my information.
Prices are too high
Prices way too high compared with other travel agents
Pricing more expensive than direct when checked after booking. Disappointed.
Professional and friendly
Professional and friendly service
Professional and very knowledgeable re my request for information.
Professional service and understood my request.
"Professional, listened to our requirements and were prepared when we arrived. The person dealing with us was not a cruise expert (we all have to start somewhere) but he was supported by the manager who was knowledgeable about cruising"
"Professional, timely, friendly<br/>"
"Prompt attention to our enquiry, the agent fully understood what we were looking for"
"Prompt attention to our enquiry, the agent fully understood what we were looking for"
promt friendly response
Provide an excellent service. They put in the extra effort to ensure you get the holiday you want.
Provide details of flight seat reservations and baggage as part of the quote rather than after deposit paid
Quality of holiday documents and speed of delivery
Quality of service from Catrina in the Edinburgh shop was exceptional.
Quick response & plenty of options

"Really disappointed to be fair. We booked our honeymoon with Kuoni back in 2014/2015, & it was beyond perfect, from the experience in your store, to the actual honeymoon.<br/>We haven't had a holiday in about 6/7yrs, due to various factors, & wanted to come back to Kuoni for that 'extra special' experience, albeit, yes, we're on a budget. <br/>It was like no one understand our brief in what we wanted, where, and what our budget was. We made our excuses & left in 10mins it was that bad."
"Really felt a lot of value from having our trip planned, and booked and organised with all the recommendations. I would have liked to have seen a breakdown of costings just to know exactly what I was paying for. <br/><br/>I know I will be paying more through Kuoni than I would if i did it myself but Its important for me to know exactly what price im paying for flights, rooms, transfers and Kuonis commision."
Really friendly and attentive staff - loved the whole holiday shopping experience at Kuoni … something I normally dread
"Really friendly staff, very knowledgeable. Quotes took a while to come back, but Easter could hsve delayed this"
Really good customer service. Travel experts easy to contact by email. Always quick to reply. Really good holiday experience. Everything went to plan. Courtesy call on return.
Really good informative and flexible service
Really good. Only slight issues was that we paid by a Bacs payment and it took a while to register on the system which was stressful as it was alot of money that transferred and there was no recipe for a few days.
"Really great and well planned, a really personal service our rep Zoe was amazing!"
"Really great organisation, this is my second time using Kuoni and they chose a great selection of resorts as always"
"Really great service, very helpful and knowledgeable"
"Really helpful all the way through. Recommendations were helpful, and alleviated my anxious mother! Communication was clear and timely.<br/><br/>Only criticism, I was sent someone’s documents wrongly, a breach of GDPR, but the response when emailed , just apologised and didn’t take it seriously. If I knew my holiday details had been sent to someone else, including my address, I wouldn’t be very happy."
"Really helpful,  we knew what we wanted,and they gave us the best of what wanted"
"Really impressed with this company so far. Kirsty my travel advisor was so professional and helpful and gave us a really good deal, I’m so pleased thank you"
"Really listened to our requirements and delivered, thank you."
Really well organised and local guides/support were great at welcoming and being approachable for any advice or questions. The final hotel was a little disappointing. I dont think it is necessary to have a guide in Hoi An. <br/>
Received information from your company by email but no follow up phone call to discuss. Very disappointed with this. Also found the quote very pricey and will not be using the company
"Recently booked a trip to Las Vegas for later on this year with Alice Blunden who works at Kuoni in Oxford Street, London.
Service was quick, efficient and friendly and I was kept up to date well regarding the
booking, quote etc.
My wife and I have been using Kouni for our USA holidays, which have been many,
for over twenty years and would highly recommend them."
"Representative did okay, friendly etc, but could have been more proactive with suggestions for Maldives holiday. Biggest surprise was when we got alternative prices from a competitor - blew Kuoni prices away."
"Responsive, excellent communication, quality information and advive"
"Rhianna was wonderful. So knowledgeable and she really listened to what we wanted and helped us chose the perfect match. I did wish we could have booked and arranged the wedding through you as well but once we arrived at Keyonna, everything ran very smoothly"
Ricky at the Milton Keynes branch is fantastic. So informative and really helpful. An asset to Kuoni
"Ricky is amazing . He has found the perfect cruise for my husband and I and goes to the trouble of explaining everything in  fine detail .Nothing  is too much trouble. A real asset to Kuoni. 
Thank you Ricky . We are super excited."
"Ricky was amazing. He listened to us, made suggestions and made our holiday come to life."
"Sam could not do enough for us, very informative and spent a long time tailoring our holiday to give us the best experience.  Would definitely book again"
Sam the agent who booked the holiday was super helpful.
"Sam was absolutely brilliant, gave us so much of her time and was a huge help going through differ t options"
"Sam was amazing, she was able to make personal recommendations that suited our families needs. We couldnâ€™t have asked for more."
"Sam was fabulous - she listened to our specific needs, made appropriate suggestions to improve our experience. This holiday is our one opportunity for a holiday of a lifetime."
Sam was really helpful throughout the whole process and made booking a multi-hotel trip seamless.
Sam was very helpful and responded quickly to all our requests
Sam was very lovely and helpful!
Samantha is great and a credit to the company. She is currently working on finding our break in the Maldives.
Samantha is great and a credit to the company. She is currently working on finding our break in the Maldives.
Sara Tavilla in Solihull has been very helpful and knowledgeable
"Seamless booking and customer service through,  very happy and satisfied throughout"
"Seen without an appointment. I am sure staff get many people just pop in with no intention of purchasing a holiday, but was given time & advice despite staff not being sure if I had any intention of ever returning. Holiday proposals forwarded by email as discussed."
"Service and emails good, kept informed of booking"
Service from the staff was excellent in findind the holoday that we wanted.  I would certainly recommend their service to others
Service in store is great and the store is well presented. I think some of the intel on locations could be more recent however.
Service rep was incredibly helpful and quick to turn things around for us
Service throughout from booking to the holiday itself was excellent.  Everyone who needed to know about Michele's allergy to pork knew about it and an alternative provided. No mean feat in Asia!  Would have been good to know that the room in the Anantara was on the 3rd floor and that there was no lift.  Not a major headache for us but might be for others.
Service was excellent but your prices were significantly more for the same holiday with another company
"Service was excellent,"
"Service was really great. Neil was lovely and very knowledgeable and helpful. Really appreciated being offered a drink, it made the overall experience much nicer. We very nearly booked with yourselves, however, we thought we’d just call in to trailfinders to get a comparison quote from them before we booked, and found that they were able to find us higher rated hotels for a cheaper overall price, for the same holiday. Therefore we booked with trailfinders instead."
Several hotels were cancelled due to refurbishment.You should establish better relations to avoid this. Flight seats could not be allocated through Vietnam Airways. You should establish better relations to avoid this.
Shana has been excellent I am a frequent traveler and usually do most of the booking myself. She was so helpful full of knowledge I had every faith in her. I will definitely use Kuoni again.
"Sharna listened to our feedback provided from previous holiday and found us the perfect hotel in Phuket, feeling quiet and private, but very close to bars and restaurants"
Sharna was very helpful and knowledgeable in every aspect of travel & advice
"Sian Hart who I dealt with was extremely helpful, and made it very easy for us to get what we wanted."
Sioned at the Chester store was brilliant throughout!
So helpful and didn't mind spending time with us
So helpful. No question ever too much for Team Norwich. Offered great options for Mum and daughter trip; and great value for money
Some of the prices quotes were almost double the prices that you could find online <br/><br/>I was expecting the fees to be less than the online ones<br/><br/>There didn’t seemed to be anything that kuoni were offering to beat the online prices or any added value being added for the additional prices <br/><br/>So could not recommend to anyone
"Someone called as requested, they agreed to call back about half an hour later as I was stuck at work. They never called back. I received an email a few days later with some questions about what we wanted and I responded and never heard back."
Sorry to say we were disappointed really. This was a trip of a lifetime and we wanted a 5 star experience. Athutuga was a fantastic location but our accomodation and drinks available did not live up to our expectations at all. Our rep Aana was sent a string of issues by us which she tried hard to rectify. The water villas are kargecand comfortable but the decor was very shabby. Plastic deck blinds were ripped and very stained as was retractable canvas blind. There were bad stains in bathroom areas. Many if the feature deck lights didnt work.<br/>Your itinery stated imac and celing fan. Neither were there and manager said they shouldnt br on inventory and theyve told you this.  The manager came and saw ys and held hands up saying he agreed with all we said but that was how it was!<br/><br/>I sent numeroud photos and video to Asna to demonstrate and she too agreed not good enough<br/><br/>We were very disappointed with drinks. Very limited all inclusive available. We asked fir prosecco and told fine. But actually all we had was cheap soainish plonk. Again just not good enough when we booked via kuoni for  best package. <br/><br/>We found even before we left we could have bought the holiday via you for £2k less. But because we booked early we couldnt take advantage of that<br/>We feel really let down. <br/>We cant affird to go somewhere like that again and what should gave been holiday of a lifetime was spoilt<br/>aana offered to move islands for us but we only gad 3 days left so declined this.<br/><br/>Diamonds athuruga clearly knew it wasnt good enough as they offered us 15% off a future holiday there. Thats no good to us as cant afford to go again<br/><br/>I hope you can compensate us for this misrepresentation. It is jot acceptable.
Speedy detailed response to our enquiry.
Stacey was very helpful and was able to show us exactly where places were.  We are going to go back later in the year as she said there will be more available then
Staff at J Lewis Reading were very helpful and knowledgeable.
Staff dealt efficiently with the booking and resolved some problems which emerged.
Staff in the Norwich branch are always very welcoming and helpful!
Staff very friendly and helpful and always prompt at responding.
Staff very welcoming and friendly
"Staff were quick, efficient and friendly and even communicated over a bank holiday weekend and whilst on holiday which was impressive. However, I ended up doing a lot of the searching myself to find the rooms in the hotel I want that suite my dates and finding flights that worked best for us. In addition it was cheaper looking at the flights directly and looking at the hotel directly. Didn’t feel like there has been much benefit so far going through the travel agency. Hoping to see some benefits now that it comes to booking."
Staff were really friendly and knowledgeable. I told them my budget and what I wanted and they were able to make good suggestions.
"Staff were very helpful whilst booking the holiday, whilst we were waiting for the holiday and, when our flight was cancelled they immediately organised an alternative. They took all the stress out of it."
Staff were very.responsive and kept me updated. They were friendly and when there were some hiccups attended to these professionally.

Stavi was excellent help
"Stay as you are , our holiday was faultless"
"Stephen at Reading provided excellent service - listened to my preferences, offered a range of options and built a bespoke 3-centre holiday. The whole experience was rushed, and a pleasure."
Stephen Bray is fantastic and very knowledgeable about the destinations we are planning on visiting.
Stephen did a fantastic job in giving me some really good options for a family holiday in the summer. Very knowledgable and incredibly patient with me. Good communication post the booking as well. Very impressed. I will be returning!
Stephen has been so helpful - he was patient whilst i worked through options and has helped me to book a wonderful trip
"Steve was excellent - very helpful, knowledgeble, polite and not pushy. He spenta lot of time and effort planning our holidays to the Maldives and Botswana."
Steve was so helpful
Steve Yates was brilliant to deal with.  Went above and beyond looking at flight options
still waiting to hear back??
Stranded in LA - We had an exceptionally stressful time with flights at the start of our holiday with a flight cancellation in LA. The only way I could contact you was on the emergency line. I had to book two flights onward to Honolulu myself. I was tired and stressed and then 5 days later was still unable to check in for my next flight. Which then carried on until our last flight with Hawaiian airlines
"Such a great experience from start to finish. Excellent advice from Stephen Murray at Reading Kuoni, resulting in a brilliant holiday."
Sue Brown has been magnificent. We are not easy types to satisfy but she has been a model of patience and a fount of good ideas.
"Sue is great, answered all questions. <br/>Offered multiple choices and narrowed down to my needs and wishes. <br/>"
Super customer service
Super helpful and efficient. Sara's recommendations were both accurate appreciated.
Super helpful staff
Superb advice and service as always.  Lynsey Wilce looked after us and was excellent.
"Superb holiday at Keyonna Beach, accomodation was immaculate, staff attentive and food delicious and varied."
Superb knowledge and enthusiasm; efficient and bespoke. Delighted to have found Kuoni. Iâ€™ve used them consistently.
"Superb service from Vicky at Milton Keynes store..  Looking at holidays for a Wedding Anniversary and my first email was with regards to finding out which of my destinations would be the best to travel to for weather at the time I wanted to go.  Contacted the store by telephone once I received the response and had a discussion about what, where and when.  The information wasnâ€™t available at the time and once it was locked into the system the store would be in contact.  Letâ€™s say contact was made, quotation sent out an holiday is now booked."
Superb service throughout
Superbly organised from beginning to end
Support before and during the trip was excellent. The extra touches were lovely too.
Susan Eaton at the reading kuoni branch plans our holidays impeccably. She is aware of our requirements and always keeps in touch to ensure e everything is as planned. The support from the reps is what brings us back to kuoni each year. Ian our rep in Colombo also goes above and beyond to male sure we are ok and if we have any queries they are answered and supported in a timely manner. Nothing is too much trouble for Susan or Ian. If it wasn't for Susan planning our holiday and the support we would not still be with kuoni.
"Susan has been really helpful, responding quickly and sharing advice and suggestions on destinations for us"
TBH I couldn't fault the entire experience!
The actual holiday hotel was was lovely the very very disappointing aspect was we paid for business class seats with BA which were economy seats with the centre seat of 3 left empty so a formal complaint will be coming your way but appreciate that you wouldn’t of probably known that either.
The actually holiday that was planned was incredible and we couldn’t fault that. However dealing with Kuoni UK side wasn’t up to the expectations I had. We had to chase a lot and communication wasn’t great
The advice given to us this time about the hotel we chose was misleading.
The advice we were given for our honeymoon was absolutely spot on!!!
"The agent helping us was amazing! She gave honest recommendations, talked about first hand experiences and really helped iron everything out. She answered all of our questions and honestly planning our honeymoon has been nothing but fun!"
"The agent I spoke to was a lovely lady, really bubbly and easy to chat to. 
However, I was unhappy with what I was offered , I disliked one of the hotels, Iâ€™d read all the reviews. When I told her this, she dismissed it completely and told me it was â€˜local charmâ€™. (Similar to an estate agent type waffle). It could have been that Kuoni simply didnâ€™t have another hotel that matched my brief to offer?!?! I know what I like, I travel often and therefore knew that I wouldnâ€™t enjoy staying there. I found the price over the top, I have found a far better product combination for a much more competitive price. Il
I missed the agents call (on out agreed call back day/time,) as I was dealing with an urgent work matter. I emailed the agent shortly after to apologise and explain weâ€™d found another option, which was ignored. 
Not great customer service at allâ€¦â€¦â€¦ I felt I was to accept what Iâ€™m was given and it wasnâ€™t negotiable. ."
The agent listened to what we wanted and produced several options to choose from. She was also very helpful and trying to sort a potential hiccup.
The agent Sam at liverpool. Was very good. I didn't book the holiday because your prices was too dear.
The assistance in booking our holiday was great
The attention to detail and personal service provided by Alex and her team is exemplary.. Our preferences and needs are always understood and acted upon without fail.
The booking experience was very good but there was some disappointment with the holiday. Please see later comments.
"The Chichester Office was very positive and helpful. My advisor, Jo Goddard, was very on the case at all times."
The communication from UK Kuoni team on designing and planning my trip was exceptional but the Holiday side was equally strong in terms of logistics and communication - a superb service all round
"The communication was poor after the first day , no follow-up to suggestions was given for over a week .<br/>"
"The consultant, Marianne Smith, was very attentive and did a great job in trying to meet my needs."
The cost quoted for our holiday was twice that quoted elsewhere.
The customer service offered by Kuoni is really good
"The customer service was exceptional whilst expensive, they did give the support needed quickly and efficiently. However there was a lack of communication between the hotel, Kuoni and ourselves to advise of the renovations at the hotel."
The customer service was very good but the holiday recommended fell way below our expectations and showed a lack of understanding about our brief/requirements.
"The customer service we received was amazing, so attentive and really helpful. Looked after us well. However the price of the holiday's were very high and we felt that we could go else where or even book ourselves for a lot cheaper. Which alternative we did, we were able to get the flights, hotel, transfers that we wanted in our budget for Dubai, where if we went with Kuoni. We would have had to paid additional £1500. <br/>We were disappointed with this as we have previously booked 3 holidays with yourselves and it has been excellent, perfect holidays and reasonably priced."
The day trips recommending need improving. Albeit day one in Bangkok was good.
The experience we were given from booking right through to arriving at the island and leaving was excellent. Everything was so well managed and all the people were so lovely it really allows you to relax and not worry about anything which is what you want on your honeymoon!
"The first time i called i had an agent who didn't seem to care, told me she was busy and would send a quote in a coupe of days. then I called back and got charlotte - who actually talked to me on the phone and helped me - she was great."
The flights were the worst we ever had. 10 hours with less legroom than a budget airline! Very poor recommendation.<br/>Several other issues as well...
"The gentleman we saw was very helpful, but it was clear that even though we were looking to spend approximately £11000 on a holiday it was well below what he was hoping we would spend"
the gentleman who helped me in store was very knowledgeable about the destinations I was interested in and provided me with all the information I required
The girls in the Liverpool were great from the moment we called into the store looking for help on where to choose for our honeymoon.<br/>Angelo at Kuramathi was excellent also<br/>The assistance we received at Male airport was amazing too (unsure of the name sadly)
The guys in SA were brilliant. Katja/Andrea & Kerstin
"The help we have had with the team in Cribbs Causeway when we booked with Rail finders, was very impressive and made what was a difficult situation so much better.
There understanding and passion to get everything right for us is why we have no intension of ever booking a holiday any where else."
The holiday experience was excellent and worth the money
"The holiday was fantastic, and the support we had from Kuoni prior to booking and during the trip was of a really high standard."
The holiday was perfect apart from the dubai hotel location
The holiday was very well organised and we didn’t have to worry about anything!
The hotel in San Francisco was slightly below the standard of the other hotels.
The hotels in the first and third destinations were disappointing.The destination of Seminyak was very polluted and a bit like Benidorm.
The hotels were fantastic and when we had an issue with a local representative it was sorted. However the flight coming back was dreadful. We had a 5 hour layover.
"The inquiry started well with the agent coming up for some excellent ideas for our trip to Singapore and Thailand. However as the process continued I became less happy. The price spiralled and I decided to sit down with Booking.com and Skyscanner to price it myself. Changing airlines brought about a massive saving as did changing our beach stay from two resorts to one only. To give Kuoni their credit they did give a discount, but the holiday was still significantly more expensive than if I had booked it myself. To rub salt into the wound, after I had paid a very substantial deposit, I was informed by Kuoni that the Emirates business class flights were of a special type and didnâ€™t give lounge access or the ability to select seats. This was the first time it was mentioned. I complained and Kuoni did change the flights to normal business class.
The experience could have been so much better."
The Kuoni rep on the island was incredible and made the holiday but we wouldn't necessarily recommend the store that we booked it through because we do not feel that it was sold right to us.
"The lack of active representation in Singapore and the slow response to our email, did not create great impressions."
The lady named Mary was excellent at giving advice on travel and options available. The slight lowering in score was down to no one seeing to us at the appointment time until 20 minutes after.
The only issue we had with the holiday was the changeover day when moving from Praslin to mahe . We left early on 9am flight to mahe and arrived at hotel about 10 but then had to wait 4 hours for room . Why not leave Praslin later in day to avoid this ??
The organisation was amazing
"The overall experience was wonderful and we thought the hotels and itinerary were just right - we never could have put it all together without doing hours of research. The only thing we’d change were some of the flight times/transfers. According to the schedule, we would have been waiting at the airport for an internal flight for 6 hours - missing a whole afternoon in Hoi An. Thankfully we were able to arrange an earlier flight with the airline and with our driver for pick up. Also, the 6 hour layover in Frankfurt to get home was not pleasant. Just those couple of things we would change."
The people at Kuoni Harrogate are fabulos and if my husban had not suddenly died we would have been there arranging our holliday with confidence.
The person we dealt with was helpful and knowledgeable
The personal help given by our travel agent Sam Leckie in the Liverpool shop is the main reason we return to Kuoni
"The personal interaction with a dedicated travel expert is invaluable.  Hayley, based at Cardiff John Lewis Kuoni, is fantastic.  So patient, I bombared her with questions and she coped with everything.  With her help we ended up with a holiday we are so excited about."
"The personal support and advice is superb, they hold you hand the whole way"
The pre departure WhatsApp we received in Kandolhu was confusing and needs to be rewritten. But everything else was superb & seamless from beginning to end
"The process was so easy from start to finish. Our initial consultation with Karen in the Edinburgh branch helped us to identify what we wanted from our honeymoon. We then received the proposals and draft itineraries quickly, which we were able to tweak until we had our perfect holiday. The holiday itself was amazing and we had no issues with any of the hotels or transfers."
"The quality of the hotels were beyond our expectations, and when we ran into trouble whilst away, the 24hr helpline was a life saver and helped us get our trip back on track quickly. All the staff we interacted with were kind and helpful and they really made us feel cared for. In addition, whilst away, the local knowledge of the reps was brilliant, as was the information we had been provided before going about what to book and why."
The quote i received did not include any of the modifications i discussed with the Kuoni representative!
The quote was almost £3k more than the company I have booked with for same level of hotels and more places
The rating isn’t necessarily for our experience with Kuoni but more regarding our agent. We’d heard amazing things from Kuoni but our agent wasn’t very helpful at all. This was our honeymoon trip and we were so excited and had dreamt of this trip for years so it was really disappointing that we left feeling the way we did
The representatives were knowledgeable and informative
The resort (Sandies Bathala Maldives)  we booked was classified as 4star . Normally I use Kuoni hotels as my benchmark as the ratings are usually spot on and we are never disappointed . However on this holiday in our opinion was  that resort should have been rated 3 star . The public areas and room was definitely not 4 star material. This was our 8th visit to the Maldives and whilst we had a lovely holiday the resort was needing several improvements .
The response took longer than expected and then the rates quoted were more than if I just googled myself or used expedia. Not sure where kuoni added value to the process
The response was prompt and detailed
The rooms that we were given were shocking.  First the two rooms were far apart.  Then we were given room next to each other.  Awful rooms for price we paid.  Never again!
The score of 10 is due to the outstanding excellent service given by Ricky Kingwell at your Milton Keynes store and past experience of many holidays booked via Ricky which have always been outstanding experiences.
The service and knowledge dealing with our request was first class as usual.
The service from Kuoni overall has been excellent
"The service from Kuoni prior to our holiday and the holiday itself wás fantastic, we will definitely be booking holidays through Kuoni in the future."
The service given by Amy in the Kuoni store in Southampton was excellent. She went out of her way to assist me and actioned everything very quickly. Sadly she was unable to get us out to the place we wanted however I felt she did everything she could to try
"The service has been excellent, Kirsty was very helpful, friendly and informative whilst booking our honeymoon.  Communication was fantastic and nothing was to much trouble.  I would happily deal with the company (especially Kirsty) again."
The service to book and prepare for our holiday was good - the rep in country was also lovely. My main issues was that some information wasn't really clear at the time of booking - e.g. it would be good to have had someone explain that we were very early season in Sardinia when we went which meant a lot of venues were closed. It would also be good to have been told to probably have a hire car for more days than we did as the hotel location was very exclusive but that also meant no other places were at a walkable distance - that meant we were a bit stuck on the days we didn't have a car. Other than this the service was great and the hotel was amazing - great food and great services.
The service was amazing. We were welcomed into the shop and served by Charlotte who made us feel right at ease. Our holiday was made to suit us and we didn’t feel at any point like just a sales pitch; it was refreshing to get such a personal service.
The service was excellent and everything worked out well for our holiday.
The service was excellent however you weren’t competitive on price - found holiday packages cheaper elsewhere.
"The service was fine, but no different than booking with a high street travel agent"
"The service was friendly and efficient, however I think should have researched my chosen hotels in more detail rather than rely on Kuoni recommendation."
The service was incredible and their knowledge was great as well. James talked through us through different hotels that would suit our needs so that we could make a decision.
The service we have had from Stacey Warley in Chelmsford has been brilliant. So lovely to deal with such a friendly accommodating person.
The service we received from our initial booking through to the holiday was superb.
The signage at Palma airport arrivals was nonexistent for Kuoni.
The staff at the booking office are first class and very helpfull nothing is trouble to them at the metro gateshead
"The staff in Reading were extremely professional but also friendly. The Manager, Sue, always went the extra mile."
"The staff were really helpful, especially when our BA flight was delayed they helped reorganise our trip"
The staff were so friendly and approachable. They fitted us in without an appointment and helped us book the most magical honeymoon. The staff were very knowledgeable.
The suggestions were way over our budget. I also had to chase the person to provide the suggestions/quotes since they weren’t provided a week after they said they would be.
The support & knowledge of the Cardiff office staff was helpful & prompt in pulling together a package quotation
The team in the branch were amazing! The holiday was fab. Would highly recommend
The travel advisor said that the hotel had watersports and a beach to swim off of. The water level was too low for swimming (with sharp coral/rocks under the surface) and the waterspouts turned out to be a couple of paddle boards which couldn't be used because of the low water.
The travel advisor was not interested in my query.  Did not offer any advice on the trip
"The travel consultant Nicola was lovely,  very knowledgeable about the resort and journey.  Kept me updated on the process of booking"
"The trip was seamless. The quality of hotel/excursions and tour guides were brilliant <br/>However, once I had paid the holiday in full communication between myself and the person who booked it was non existent. I had emailed 3 separate queries and did not receive an answer and had to go searching for the answer myself. This was disappointed as it felt once he closed the deal on our holiday he no longer was Interested.  I happy to accept something may have happened to this person which made him unable to answer, however our qu’oripeau should then have been transferred to another member of the team."
The whole booking experience was excellent - Laura (Harrogate branch) took the time to understand and listen to our requirements for our honeymoon - and then completely exceeded our expectations!
"The whole booking process was smooth and trouble free, Chris at Kuoni manchester was very knowledgeable regarding the resorts and helped up pick the best resort for what we were after from our honeymoon"
The whole process was seamless. Nicola listened to our requirements and found us just what we wanted.. her knowledge is excellent.
The whole service was great from booking to departure
"The young lady who served us in the Chichester shop, Jo, was lovely....friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and took on board what we were looking for (even though we weren't exactly sure what we were looking for!!) and came up with a ""starting point"" itinerary and quote within 10 days (and she wagon holiday for 7 of those days)   that is why we visited Kuoni...not used before but our understanding was that the service levels were excellent and so it has proved so far."
There have been issues with the villa we had at our property and feel we were misled by the person who booked the holiday. This is being looked into.
There is not much you could have done better to be honest
"There was a passenger name misspelling on our booking, which resulted in lots of last-minute stress the day before flying. I will commend the action of the operations team who sorted it for us and gave us contact information for the rest of the trip (in case of further problems). We did lose seat allocation on JetBlue flight, so had to sit apart. <br/>The NYC hotel was not acceptable. We stayed in a nice hotel in Las Vegas and had high hopes for NYC. The room was tiny, with nowhere to hang clothes. We were in a disabled room, with a poor sliding door and wet room. It put a real damper on our trip, so we checked on after one night and booked a hotel ourselves. <br/>This was a special 60th birthday trip, so I wanted it to be special for my husband with all the strain taken / professional attention from the travel agent to make sure it ran smoothly and we had a great trip. Unfortunately, I could have booked the trip with less stress without Kuoni."
There was no follow up to the quotation so that I could discuss it further
"There was no hard sell I visited the Trafford centre branch and called in to ask about a trip, that I have been planning for my 50th birthday. I was given in depth details of a trip from Lauren she didnâ€™t need to look it up her knowledge was great, she talked me through any additions that I may like to do and advised that I could book now even though the trip isnâ€™t for 15months.
The trip is through their sister company but again she spoke highly about this.
I was given a brochure and her personal contact details so looked into the trip at home and decided what I needed, after leaving a message at the branch I didnâ€™t hear back so I emailed with further questions.
Andrew called me promptly apologised having not received the telephone message due to technical issues but had all my questions answered so I promptly booked the  trip.
Andrew was fantastic, attentive and personable over the phone.
The customer service so far has been great and I would highly recommend the team at trafford. Working in a customer environment myself I would hold on to the two employees as this is why I have booked my holiday with you!"
"There was only one major disappointment. After a 14 hour flight,our room was not available for 5 hours. Surely this is  common problem and needs more attention."
there wasn't much availability and the hotels took a long time to get back to the agent.  this meant that the holiday was no longer available by the time that they did
"There were 2 issues we have with our booking: 1) We were not made aware of pre trip requirements for entry to Seychelles, resulting in us incurring additional costs and stress. 2) The transfers between location in terms of wait times were completely unsatisfactory and not communicated to us. We could have arranged more efficiently ourselves so why have an agent do it for us? We won't use Kuoni again on this basis."
They handled the hole experience very well
"They listened to my requirements, offered me options and the best of all were not pushy."
They listened to what we linked about holiday what we didnâ€™t like but were also not afraid to suggest wild card hotels! We felt so comfortable with them and the girls were amazing with helping us book our honeymoon! We all think there should be a tiki bar in there;)
They stayed in touch keeping me informed
"They took all the hassle out of booking our trip, in a very short time . Taking care of all the little details e may have overlooked. Excellent service at a  good price. I expect if we had shopped around we could have got it cheaper but it saved us all the hassle and time to have Kuoni sort it out"
They were happy to listen to understand my requirements.  Nothing was too much trouble.  They changed the holiday options many times until I was happy to book.
"they were responsive and helpful. They listened to what I wanted from my holiday, came up with some excellent ideas and adapted them to suit our family."
They were very thorough in checking every aspect of our proposed holiday to ensure it met our needs.
This holiday had ok elements but some not so good
"This holiday was originally booked before Covid, followed by the death of my mother, which meant that it has taken a long time to make the arrangements Kuoni were understanding and allowed me to take the time before committing to the holiday"
This is about the 5th time we have used Kuoni the hotels are always of very high standard and the experience is second to none.
This is our 2nd time using Kuoni for a special long -haul holiday. We have no suggestions.
This is our third trip with Kuoni and they are always our go to when we need inspiration.
This is the third holiday we have undertaken with Kuoni. We have always found the staff to be helpful and friendly and prepared to go out of their way to give us a perfect holiday experience
This survey is a bit premature. I am currently waiting to hear how my request is going
This was our first trip booking with Kuoni. Alix worked amazingly well with our long list of requirements to come up with 3 options.  Whilst away Kerry took care of things amazingly well.  On Alix return the booking went through swiftly and without issue.  Letâ€™s hope the actual holiday goes just as well
Thought the holiday was value for money and that most transfers went very smoothly. Agents very knowledgeable about destinations and hotels.
Too expensive for the average family to afford. I felt quote was at least £7000 than I would have expected.
Too expensive. Quality of accommodation poor. Service at hotel not great.
Took their time until I was happy with the arrangments and did not try and force anything on me I didnt want.
Took time to build a strong understanding of the need. Developed a strong plan and was able to flex and adjust this as the brief evolved. Perfect can  recommend the service highly.
Transfer wasn’t arranged to collect us from the airport - no follow up communication as promised regarding. Realty disappointing service
"Tremendous help from knowledgeable staff who had experienced the resorts and accommodation they were advising on.
Charlotte went out of her way to relate her own experiences and gave pointers to what we could expect on our holiday"
UK team not as knowledgeable on Africa as the should be. Itinary lacked a lot of detail. Kuoni Rep in Johannesburg answered our questions incorrectly. Travelling with our son and daughter 27 and 20 every time were faced with a double bed rather than single beds
"Understood our needs, made us feel extremely welcome & knowledgeable in her field."
"Understood what we were looking for, provided 3 combinations that fitted the brief. We asked for 1 alternative combination then booked. Could not have been easier."
Unfortunately we could not find anything affordable at the time we visited
Unfortunately we didn't receive any proposals that matched our requirement despite reconfirming what we were looking for several times. We decided to use another company in the end. It's a shame as Kuoni were recommended to us.
"Unlike many other travel agents or other outlets with remote communications, Kuoni always had people available who were familiar with the booking and more than happy to help"
Use more airlines and offer AI in hotels
Use other airlines rather than British Airways and Heathrow. The previous holiday with Kuoni you used BA and they were bad then and have not improved. 1 hour late take off on return and 40 mins wait for baggage. Now that Heathrow is proposed to be included in the ULEZ if Kuoni only offer BA/Heathrow we will not be using you again.
"Very accommodating and diligently looking at all options; will definitely book again,"
Very clear information and tailored to our needs
Very difficult to add anything when the booking was completed online
"Very easy to book, easy to get help with any queries before travel and excellent local representatives at the destination."

Very good service and support from start to finish.
"very good support, the travel agent has been arranging and found very good alternative once the hotel choose didn't had availability for the selected date."
"Very happy- only slight drawback was no rep in the area. Also, be aware that at this time of year St.Moritz is in mid season and was pretty dead with most shops shut. The trip itself was well worth while."
Very happy with the service
Very happy with the support from Kuoni over this holiday.<br/>Thanks to Jared Brown of Kuoni Norwich for his support thoughout- exemplary customer service!!

Very helpful and friendly staff at our local Aberdeen branch. They have personal experience of holiday destinations and can use this knowledge to advice clients to pick not only a memorable holiday but a lifetime experience. Coffee is fabulous too.
Very helpful and friendly staff.
"Very helpful and friendly travel expert, accommodated all our requests and booked our honeymoon in one seating, very smooth process. Usually helps if you have a clear idea where your destination is, what you want to do and which resorts you prefer."
Very helpful and gave information very quickly. Jack worked hard to attempt to answer our need
Very helpful and informative. A 2nd person came to assist as Jordan was new to the role. Always courteous. Would have been good to agree a price range as the final holiday was a lot more than we had budgeted for.
Very helpful and knew what we wanted

"Very helpful and personable staff, particularly Marianne and Jack who both went over and above."
Very helpful and personalised service so difficult to think of anything extra!
Very helpful and professional service throughout. We were very impressed with the booking process in particular.
Very helpful and the best. No suggestions at this point. Everything went smooth :)
Very helpful and very quick in responding.  It would have been useful to provide more advice for example that the area I was suggesting had a worse climate at that time of year then a different area of the country especially as having routed around myself this is on their website.
Very helpful from booking process to the holiday and always answered phone or email quickly
Very helpful girl Helen.    And researched everything I asked . . No issues at all

Very knowledgeable and nothing to much trouble. Kept up to date. Good that they can give advice as they have been which I felt was very important.
Very knowledgeable staff and accommodating on varying options
"Very knowledgeable staff who often advise using personal experience. No request is too much trouble. Friendly, efficient and helpful- the staff at Kuoni Cardiff have become my friends"
Very organised but need to allow more timefor airport transfer only just got through passport control airport very busy.
Very patient and helpful staff
Very patient with us in making up our mind. Also really appreciated all the suggestions and recommendations. We find kuoni to be excellent
Very pleased with the experience and quality of accomodation
very pleased with the prompt service & attention
Very professional & informative from start to finish
Very professional and informative service from the Kuoni Travel Consultant who sold us our holiday right through to the in resort reps.  First class.
Very professional and patient made us feel comfortable and important.
Very professional yet friendly and extremely knowledgeable
Very pushy
"Very quick to sort out a small issue we had. However, some of the hotels we stayed at were not of the quality expected."
Very quiet in store had the full attention and advice of all staff to tailor the best holiday
Very slow conversation which took 30 mins just to discuss Kenya. Wasn't asked what I wanted first and foremost so majority of time was spent telling me about different set packages. Never had any follow up even though I was promised a tailored package quote. No problem anymore as I am going with another travel company
"Very unhappy with the service in the Bluewater store, no attention to the details (for example due to the airline changing flight times we were paying for 7 nights but only staying 6 nights) although changes were made it required us to notice  and request.<br/>No contact from Kuoni at the hotel, we had to ask the hotel for departure/collection times.<br/>We don't mind doing this but then what are we paying Kuoni for? Given we could have saved nearly £500 by not using Kuoni so a very poor value service.<br/><br/>We will not be returning to the Bluewater store."
Very well understood our needs. Very knowledgeable
Vey friendly and efficient
Vicky has been most helpful.
Vicky has been very helpful and friendly with us in getting our honeymoon booked
Way to expensive I got the same holiday £1000 cheaper
We already have for your great service and holiday choice
"We also had amazing service from Kuoni, we have booked with you on several occasions and trust you and all the advice given."
We always receive friendly expert guidance with ideas on travel locations & hotels. This holiday we wanted to fly from the local airport in Bournemouth and we were recommended a fabulous holiday staying in the best hotel.  Just perfect.
We always receive great service when we attend the Milton Keynes store. Vicky and Ricky are very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what they do.
"We are very happy with our holiday experience. A small glitch was the fact that your local agents in Nairobi who took us on a planned first full day tour were initially unaware that we had booked for the tour to include a lunch and a visit to the Karen Blixen Museum in Nairobi and were actually taking us back to the hotel when we raised the issue with them. They then immediately followed up by contacting their head office who checked and confirmed that a lunch and the museum. We were taken to a very nice restaurant for lunch and then to the museum. No harm done, the guide and driver acted promptly and it seems there had been some miscommunication between them and their head office. This was  not a problem for us and we gave our driver and guide a good review for their local quality control as they were very pleasant and helpful."
We booked our long haul travel days in Thai land / Bali when a couple & then our marriage in Sri Lanka  & the Maldives back 20 years ago - since then & having a family we have not travelled far for holidays but this holiday is a big one for us - so now with this holiday we wanted it to be super special we have gone back to book with Kuoni for another long haul adventure in Mauritius but this time a family holiday - which will be the first time our children will be travelling long haul trip so we wanted to make sure that it would be a high quality holiday experience - not leaving things to chance so therefore due to our previous experiences & the companies good reputation for luxury holidays we decided to book only with Kuoni again. <br/>I like to do admin etc face to face so I booked by visiting our local high street store which was a 40 min travel away from where we live. I really appreciated the travel expert offering me an hour to look at options that was a booked appointment as I am very busy with juggling family life. I ended up visiting the shop 3 times before booking as we were considering all the options for our budget… Knowing that this was a big holiday for us I wanted to be sure it would have everything we wanted.<br/>The travel expert - at Chichester Store Harriet Glass & her manager Kelly were both very helpful due to an initial disappointment with a booking which in the end resolved itself and we are now still able to go to the hotel of our choice despite Kuoni offering other options / <br/>Harriet really did take our booking seriously in terms of professionalism in dealing with our initial disappointment & by her contacting the hotel direct & bookings team we were able to secure our booking finally to our chosen hotel for our celebration of life - family dream holiday.  <br/>We had  booked holidays for 2020 but due to the covid pandemic they were cancelled & refunded in full by Hayes Travel. We were happy with their customer service but would not risk a long haul big holiday with a big agent - who do not specialise in long haul travel. <br/>When travelling with Kuoni we have always been totally satisfied with the service from booking through to the return journey - therefore we have returned to book again for this big celebration family holiday. As it is important that the experience is quality as it is an important holiday for us. <br/><br/>Thank you for hopefully making another dream holiday become a reality for us - the first long haul trip as a family… Hopefully my children will be blown away by the surroundings compared to Europe and also it will be a chance for us as a family to relax and make some magical memories in a beautiful place with all the facilities we would want from an all inclusive package… <br/><br/>I have had a very serious health condition and lots of hospital treatment - booking this holiday represents us coming together as a family and celebration of my road to recovery. I myself feel so very grateful that we can now plan this holiday as it’s an opportunity to travel to a beautiful place & especially to make memories that will hopefully stay with my children for their lifetime…
We called  into the shop in miltonkeynes to get a price for a holiday in koh samui  the lady we saw  could not have been more helpful and pleasant we received the information through  by email  every thing was explained in great detail  unfortunately the price was just to high  but thank you anyway
"We chose Kuoni again because we had such an amazing all around experience with our first Kuoni holiday in 2019. It was comparably poorer. The rep for this trip was hard to reach, did not understand our written requests even after multiple repeats, then went on leave without telling us that they reassigned our holiday to a different rep. Also, while with our first trip all the information was available on our account on the website, here it was not even after asking our rep to update. We also found it weird that flight info was sent out only 2 weeks prior to departure, thus we missed out on booking upgraded seats. <br/>The holiday itself was fantastic and we had no problems with our trip at all."
We couldnâ€™t be more pleased with the dedicated service and professional expertise of our personal travel expert - Laura. She worked tirelessly to get us the bespoke holiday     hoped for.. We are thrilled with the package!
"We decided to go with a recognised expert travel company and was not disappointed in our choice. We spoke with Jane Case who was excellent. She was very friendly and highly knowledgable about the group of Islands we wanted to visit. She took the time to understand our exact requirements and was able to recommend the most suitable one for our requirements having visited the Island herself, having taken the time to provide a selection pf possible destinations. The whole booking experience was easy and professional. Jane is an excellent ambassador for Kuoni and I would not hesitate in recommending this company."
We did not feel that some of the properties in your portfolio are at the level we would expect from a luxury travel agency. One of our tours was also very unsafe and we didn't feel it was very good value for money.
"We did not get the right support while on holiday. I requested a flight amendment which took ages to return with some quotes , the team was not able to provide this service. I. Had to do it in my own, online. I do wonder what is the Kuoni difference in this case, completely in able to assist though I could resolve the issue personally and with the hotels assistance"
"We did not have any contact with the Kuoni rep at the second resort until she e mailed pick up time (and got the flight wrong). Our first rep was really helpful and met with us. <br/>Also we had concerns over our driver to the airport who unlike previous drivers who were welcoming and informative as well as good drivers,  was very nervous, not a confident driver and made no conversation at all. We actually thought we were lucky to get there without being involved in an accident."
We didn't get any paperwork/information on transfers etc until chasing <br/>Flight information was incorrect and had the speak with the Airline to be able to check in<br/>We had to chase the local contact in Croatia constantly for information relating to transfers etc
We feel you should provide a breakdown of the holiday costing on customer invoices as other travel agents do.
"We felt let down with our final accommodation on the trip, as it was not conducive with the rest of the holiday and where we had stayed previously."
We felt that more research should have gone into the hotel recommended
"We found the booking experience admirable,"
"We gave Vicki at Milton Keynes a 'shopping list' of places we wanted to visit and things we wanted to see, and between her and the team in India they compiled an excellent itinerary. Everything worked perfectly and the arrangements could not have gone more smoothly. There was nothing at all for us to worry about. I cannot praise them highly enough"
We had a big issue having paid to come back business class we didn’t get it <br/>Humiliated in front of the line of people trying to book in <br/>Rang for help from Koni local rep who didn’t won’t to know <br/>Also only had contact with rep in resort for the journey back to hotel after arriving   <br/>
We had a fantastic holiday. Karen choose the itinerary well for our expectations. The locations we visited all get a 10 out of 10.<br/>Just a couple of organisational hiccups.
We had a few issues with our honeymoon that we had booked namely:<br/>- We had agreed during booking that we would not pay an additional night stay at our final hotel due to the late return flight and would attempt late check out at the resort if possible. We later discovered this had been booked against our wishes and plan and have been unable to cancel the extra night stay despite checking out early.<br/>- Didn't get much in resort support when we had issues with hotels<br/>- Alila Seminyak and Alila Ubud were massively different in comparison to service despite being sold that they were similar 5 star hotels.<br/>- Our hotel on Gili T had terrible wifi connectivity that required different passwords every other day. You had to pay for any activity on resort that in previous holidays and of this standard of hotel was included.
We had a good first experience with Kuoni. The Kuoni reps in destinations were great and very helpful. Some of the information that was provided prior to selecting our destinations could of been better.
"We had a great time returning to Kandolhu. <br/>Fantastic service overall from all aspect of our holiday.<br/>However we were kept waiting for our table booked for 9pm at the Japanese restaurant and did not sit down until 9.25pm..<br/>Management need to explain to guest that they need to vacate their places before 9pm.( 7pm sitting)<br/>A free cooking course was offered as compensation, which was nice but does not work  for me.<br/>We are not difficult guest ,however we were told at 8.35 pm on another evening to vacate our table ( .7 pm sitting (Japanese restaurant a few days later .<br/>Perhaps lessons were learnt.<br/>No ,<br/>We had a Mexican booked for lunch at 1.30 pm most days ,lovely setting on the jetty ,lovely breeze on these hot days.<br/>However at 2.30pm we had a bunch of upstart guests from Malaysia who had "" booked"" the Mexican for 7 people .<br/>We were told by the chef that they were waiting for their booking booked last moment for 2.30?????<br/>Rushed to finish our drinks and no time to enjoy the ambience. <br/>Just because these guest was vocal ,we were once again disappointed. <br/>1 hour for our lunch ??? not acceptable.<br/>This sitting was laid out for 2.30pm even though 1.30pm was the final sitting for the afternoon..<br/>That was our only issues. <br/>We were however impressed by the number of hangers and decaf coffee laid on for us .<br/>They remembered our previous request from our previous visit and had our favourite room <br/>103.<br/><br/>"
We had a lovely experience travelling to Victoria Falls and Chobe National Park. We enjoyed seeing the beautiful waterfalls. My children liked seeing the elephants and lions that roamed across the grasslands. Our guide was informative and helpful. We throughly enjoyed the trip.
"We had a number of issues with trying to get the correct flights we requred.
The operator did everything she could to get the flights we wanted and at the right price.
Couldent be happier."
"We had a terrible experience with the airline not knowing about my severe nut allergy despite me checking in with Kuoni before the flight, and during the holiday to ensure they know for the return flights. I was out at risk and very upset."
We had a very good experience booking our holiday. Louis was really helpful and very experienced.
We had a very positive experience. The only thing that was missing that would have been helpful was check in and out times - especially for the safari as we could have missed the first game drive
We had a voucher for a complementary breakfast and lunch. The hotel was not aware of this. So we never got it.
We had a wonderful holiday. The process of booking it was smooth and we felt well looked after.
We had a wonderful time.
"We had an amazing experience with Amy from the Southampton store. She made booking our honeymoon a breeze, had organised some great options for us to look at. Her inside knowledge of Mauritius was amazingly helpful in helping us settle on a destination. It was absolutely the best experience we've had with a travel agent and we will definitely work with Amy and Kuoni in future."
"We had an amazing holiday booked by Bekki in the Manchester store, she was very thorough & very helpful with any queries"
"We had an issue with the Heritance Hotel in Kandalama in that the jacuzzi bath in our room was not working,we did report it to reception staff but nothing was done.<br/>We also had a couple of issues in the Centara Ceysands Resort & Spa Hotel, the shower room in our room had mildew & slime on the glass partition again we reported it to reception it was cleaned but not totally. Because of this we were granted an extension to our checkout time but there was a communication issue with this as the reception staff were unaware of it,also we had a spa treatment organised & paid for us through family members as it was our 40th Wedding Anniversary, twice we were ordered to vacate our room ,once with a phone call and once with a note pushed under the door despite the extension from a manager.<br/>Also we were ordered to pay for the spa treatment 3 times despite showing photographic proof that it had been paid for previously by relatives."
"We had an issue with the wrong flights being booked by our Kuoni agent. We did not realise until closer to the holiday and then had to pay a significant amount of money to change the flights. The initial response from our Kuoni store was very disappointing and dismissive, eventually we were offered a small amount of goodwill towards the cost which we accepted but I don’t think it was a fair outcome and the way it was handled especially at the beginning was disappointing. <br/><br/>During our holiday with Kuoni before we had contact from the store in the weeks before the holiday to help us with anything else we needed and check it there was any questions. This time we heard nothing at all and it was a totally different experience! I did not feel it was any better then booking the holiday ourselves directly with the hotel and airline and actually would have been less hassle given the mistake made with the flight booking."
"We had been looking for that dream Christmas and new year holiday in Mauritius for almost four weeks with other agencies and had come up with a number of places that we liked but we’re not
Completely suitable and the costs were creeping up and up. We turned to Kuoni thinking it was a last straw and it would be too expensive. We were gobsmacked at the attention to our needs. We need adjoining rooms, all inclusive and specific dates, and much more. We were presented with four options and one which has now become our confirmed booking. Our advisor, Chennai, was a true ambassador for the island, and having spent time there herself she was very knowledgable. Nothing was too much of a problem for Chynna. We’re very happy and absolutely thrilled to be going."
"We had excellent service when booking a special celebratory holiday.
The first hand knowledge of the hotels was extremely helpful"
"We had no real problems, everything went really well"
We had requested a relaxing holiday at a single location and were suggested to do a safari and beach holiday.  Whilst both were excellent all the flights (7 in total) made it a tiring time away.
We had some issues with the hotel which put a bit of negative spin on the holiday. We were grateful of the support we had from our Kuoni rep but booking through Kuoni I would hope that the level of hotel wouldn’t have issues.
We had specified that we would like to walk out of our hotel to explore however this was not possible. On arrival we were told it would be a 20 minute taxi journey to the nearest town
We had to chase up the pick up time at the hotel for transfer as we were not informed
We had to pay Virgin Atlantic an additional £110 for our seats and this was not made clear to us when we booked. Food on flights was diabolical.
We have been very happy in the past
"We have booked long-haul trips with Kuoni several times over the years, so wouldn't go to anyone else. Richard was brilliant - knowledgeable, friendly and helpful, coming back quickly with options to suit our party and budget."
We have booked many holidays with Kuoni and have been satisfied every time with the service we have experienced.
We have booked with Melissa a number of times and she is always a pleasure to deal with and listens to what we are looking for to help us arrange a holiday we love.
We have booked with Melissa a number of times and she is always a pleasure to deal with and listens to what we are looking for to help us arrange a holiday we love.
We have booked with you before but your pricing on this occasion was not competitive. (£2000 more for identical holiday to Thailand)
We have dealt with Sam before at the Liverpool branch- she knows us and advising us appropriately - she is amazing
"We have had 2 holidays with you and up to now we have had excellent service, staff have been attentive to our needs and have provided a personal touch on both trips"
We have had many great holidays with Kuoni before and returned to book again .the details given about our chosen destination was informative and so helpful due to previous experience with Kuoni I trust them whole heartedly to deliver not just a holiday but a great experience
We have high expectations of Kuoni and you lived up to them once again.
"We have noted that the standard of hotel and service has slipped considerably since our last trip, the Kyoto hotel had no facilities at all no bar, poor cafe not up to normal std 2 star at best"
"We have travelled with Kuoni in the past and have always had a great experience but that is what we pay for.  Others I have spoken to, when talking about holidays say you're very expensive compared to other companies so not sure what you can do about this"
We have used Kooning a few times now and have never had any issues.
We have used Kuoni a total of 5 times and the service provided has deteriorated to a point where we will probably not choose them again.
We have used Kuoni before for our holidays and will continue to do so. The advice and flexibility are both excellent.
"We have used Kuoni many times, but prefer to discuss in store and our local agency has been closed."
We have used Kuoni several times and will continue to do so. Professional and helpful advice.
"We pud absolutely recommend Kuoni, and Hayley in particular. Professional, friendly and able to answer every question we asked."
We rarely recommend anything as other people's experiences may not be the same as ours.
"We received great advice and help on deciding where to go!  Once we narrowed it down, the staff are very knowledgeable on the area - and we received great recommendations on hotels and things to do.  Confirmed and booked within a few days !"
"We recently returned from a 12 night stay in the Oberoi resort in Mauritius. This was our fourth visit to the Oberoi all of which were booked through Kuoni.<br/>As always our stay at the Oberoi was beyond excellent!  However, we were rather surprised that for such a prestigious holiday we were only provided with a group transfer to/from the resort.  This was not a problem when arriving, as we were only sharing with one other couple, and the coach was comfortable. However, on our return trip to the airport we were sharing a couch full of other holidaymakers and their luggage in a trailer. The coach was ancient, noisy and barely able to climb the hills on the way and extremely uncomfortable. And this also entailed visits to multiple resorts, making it a very long journey back to the airport.  We really did not think this was acceptable for such an upmarket booking. Interestingly, for all three previous visits, we were given a private transfer to the resort."
We thought we’d booked a more exclusive “Kuoni” holiday but we got a Tui/jet2 holiday so we were very disappointed. We didn’t even feel as though the room was an upgraded version by  booking via Kuoni! Certainly didn’t seem like value for money!
"We visited Kuoni to search for honeymoon options and we’re thrilled that Adam was able to assist us with our dream trip! His knowledge, understanding and bespoke tailoring of our package made for a dream honeymoon! We absolutely can’t wait until our trip albeit it seems a while away! Thank you again we wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Kuoni and Adam to any family and friends considering a trip in future"
"We visited two islands in the Maldives and both islands were lovely. However, we were initially a little disappointed with the second island as it didn't live up to the high expectations conveyed by the Kuoni agent when booking (we were lead to believe it would be a far superior experience than the first island which is why we visited it second). The accommodation, friendliness of staff and meal plan were all inferior compared to our first island."
"We went into the Harrogate store, staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome, so knowledgeable and helpful, we were given options and ideas and nothing was too much trouble."
"We went on 3 excursions and I just want to say that our tour guide, Javed, was absolutely amazing. He was passionate about his country and he was so knowledgeable. He definitely made sure we had the best time. <br/>Sheela our kuoni representative was lovely as well, it was very helpful for her to meet us to give us information regarding our excursions/information about the country. She was always quick to answer any questions we had. <br/>The excursion to St Louis (not with Javed), however, was a bit disappointing. In the description of the excursion in the kuoni brochure made it seem like it was a bit more than what it was. It stated that we were going to have a tour of Chinatown, however, we just visited a single vendor for 2 minutes then left. There wasn’t as much street food available to us as we thought, so that was a little disappointing too. We also visited 3 museums, but I was under the impression that we were only visiting 1. Maybe a more detailed/realistic itinerary should be provided instead of the brief description to avoid disappointment for future customers."
We were 2nd booking in big party of 10 and not the lead organiser so our only experience directly with you was a slight delay with taxi transfer to airport. The whole holiday went extremely well
"We were delighted with Kuoni for arranging a lovely holiday for us. Our only issue was, with my wife being semi-disabled, lack of proper arrangements for assistance meant we lost our connection flight in Doubie and a day of our holiday."
"We were delighted with our holiday.  Huge thanks to Vicki Bramley who helped us with planning the trip and responded quickly and positively to our many pre-departure questions!  Very impressed with the Indian partner company who looked after us brilliantly.  Particular thanks to the local guides, especially Lokendra in Khajuraho who organised an excellent evening for us at the Temple sounds and sights show and dinner, and Jash  in Agra who was outstanding. Samantha is Goa was also great. We thought the Pugdundee Treehouse Hideaway was the best place we stayed. We would have liked some shopping time. Also a visit to a Hindu temple would have been nice."
"We were fortunate to get a great hotel change , even though the original hotel was under refurbishment.Good in store support and flexible payment option."
"We were greeted by the manager, Ricky Kingwell, who proved to be knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. Although we decided not to take advantage of his suggestions I wouldnâ€™t hesitate to go to his shop again."
We were impressed with the service on holiday and how responsive everyone was with booking. It was difficult to have the flexibility we wanted with flights<br/>
"We were living in Canterbury and the branch closed. Josh continued to be our lead contact online, this then changed to Jack at Bluewater, which again was fine. He has now moved and our nearest branch, as we have also moved is Gateshead. We do prefer the excellent in branch service which no other travel agent provides and had become part of the lead up to our holiday."
We were pleased with our holiday overall. We spent along time in the store (there were some technical issues) so that’s why we marked it slightly down.
"We were sold a garden room, these rooms lead directly into the garden., then the beach. Ours was the only room that didn’t access the beautiful garden which was disappointing.<br/>The menu was limited so when repeated in the second week our choices reduced. We only found we could we could eat off menu when we checked out. <br/>This is no longer a boutique hotel, it’s too big for that now. <br/>The staff are great, the grounds are amazing and the sea is lovely."
"We were told that there would be a Kuoni representative in our resort but this was not the case. The representative did contact us on our first evening and promised to send us info about the area but nothing arrived. Fortunately we knew something of the area anyway. Having said that, when I contacted her to see if our arrangements for coming home had changed (in view of the funeral of Berlusconi) she dealt with it speedily and efficiently."
"We were unable to find anything during our visit, which I was totally fine with, however I was promised that some additional options would be sent. I’m still waiting, despite chasing!"
"We were very disappointed with our first room as there were six massive air-conditioning units just below our window that sounded like jet engines. They were able to give us another room the next day. Although it was much quieter it was much smaller and very tired with paint peeling off after a not recent water leak and flooring lifting, probably from the same leak. The shower was just an over bath shower head which were quite surprised about for the standard of room that we had paid for.     In spite of all the above it didn’t ruin our holiday but just feel that you should be aware of these issues."
We were very happy with the booking in the main but were not informed about the need for a visa for one of our destinations
"We were very impressed by hotel, transfers and the rep in Italy. Only downside was lounge we went to (booked by Kuoni) was poor compared to No 1 and club rooms which we normally do."
"We were very pleased with the whole trip, everything was well organised, the local representatives were on hand if we needed them. All the private transfers were punctual with very good drivers. All the hotels were informed about my coeliac food requirements. The hotel choices in South Africa were superb, the hotel in Mauritius was a little difficult for coeliacs because of the buffets but otherwise very good."
We were very satisfied with your service!
We will be submitting a complaint detailing the issues
We will most definitely recommend family and friends to Kuoni!
We would have appreciated full details of our ‘all inclusive’ booking at our trip as we found out on arrival at our resort the rules of the all inclusive and it’s not what we expected - setting expectations by your team would have helped our experience.
We would like to say how nice it had been deal with one of your travel advisers Charlotte she<br/>Is very professional and efficient a true lady.<br/><br/>Sadly it was the high cost of the quote.<br/><br/>We were dearly hoping to travel with once<br/>Again.<br/>  <br/>
We would recommend Kuoni and would use Kuoni for future trips. They have made our honeymoon enjoyable and very easy to travel around remote destinations. You are guided at every stage of your trip so there is never a point where you are unsure about where you are going or how you are getting there. The quality of hotels chosen for us by our Kuoni agent were exceptional.
"We would very much like to thank Ricky for his help and guidance. Being able to speak with someone who had first hand experience of not only our destination and hotels, but who also listened to what we wanted, and gauged exactly what we were looking for.<br/>Excellent."
Website is clear but not flexible enough.  We are able to travel on any day in a set month but prices/availability are only quoted for a single day
Well informed staff who responded quickly. Competitive prices
Well you sent me one reply but never followed up on it.
We're always happy with KUONI and have been using them for a number of years so we must be pleased with the service.
We're delighted we picked Kuoni. The travel rep spent 2hrs talking us through all the options we'd given her and explaining clearly why some would work and some wouldn't at the time of year we were going. She also saved us around £800 by shopping around for a different elephant experience to the one flagged by the website.
What we were sold on the booking wasn't what we fully ended up receiving. This was disappointing. The hotel blamed Kuoni and suggested that you talk to the resort again about what services are actually available.
"Whatever the holiday experience that you are looking for, there is always somebody at Kuoni who can help and give first class assistance."
When the starting point is we have approx £10k for a holiday and one hotel didn’t quite work out….we would have thought every effort would be made to hang on to our business and suggest alternatives.
When we arrived at the hotel the room we had booked and paid for 6 months in advance was not available.  We had to stay in a lesser room for the first night and then move for the second night into the room we had booked.  The hotel were not very forthcoming with any compensation etc. for the inconvenience
"When you have a holiday with a long itinerary and it keeps being sent to you it’s not always obvious what the changes are especially flights and what the implications are eg airport a long drive away, long wait at airport between flights. It would be better if just these changes and implications could be communicated"
whilst it allows for ease of planning it is not necessary the most cost effective way to book a holiday
"Whilst the service and information provided was very good, the prices were not competitive with identical offers found elsewhere."
"Whilst the service initially was excellent, we had wished to book seats for the flight which we had paid for BA premium economy as two together but your staff were not able to assist. Eventually I booked directly but all the type of seats we desired were gone. Given this holiday was to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary this put a dampener on things. Also when we went to the store to pay the holiday balance my wife was on crutches and none of the staff who were on the telephone bothered to assist her with a seat whilst she waited, extremely shabby I thought when I arrived, I had been parking! A final point was we were required to go to the airport at the destination some 3 hours plus before the flight, this despite the hotel being 5 minutes from the airport and we already had our seats booked. As it turned out we were checked in and through all checks in 10 minutes, meaning a long and uncomfortable wait in a busy departure lounge."
"Will always recommend Kuoni to family members and friends, as mine and my wife’s experience has been by far truly amazing."
"Winnie was great and helpful. We gave her all the details and why we wanted to do what we where doing.  Let us go away and think about it. Called the next day with a few more questions and the branch manager answered, I asked to speak to Winnie but was told she's busy so she would help us instead. Felt like we were having to repeat alot of what we had already explained to Winnie (had she just let Winnie call us back we wouldn't have had that problem). Advised branch manager we had priced up the exact same deal with Emirates holidays and it was £1,000 cheaper, her tone changed however she did ask us to send her the publicly available quote and she would see if it could be matched"
With 2 destinations booked we were very pleased by one destination/package but let down on the package at the other destination
"Wonderful customer service as always by highly skilled knowledgeable travel consultant, who took time to discuss options provided guidance / expertise to allow me to make right decision, no push to book immediately when reviewing final options 
Seem less booking experience immediate email confirmation 

Thank you as always Kuoni metro centre Gateshead"
Wonderful personal service. Vicky was very knowledgeable and put together a brilliant itinerary for us.  She was very patient when we kept asking for changes.
"Wonderful service, far better than any high street provider 
Great insight 
Professional 
Passionate about the islands 
Main thing for myself was, easy to deal with
PERFECT 10/10"
Wonderful service. I made an online enquiry for a holiday to Maldives. The response was very fast. Faye looked after all my request very well with also giving me other options.
Wonderful to have a personal point of contact. And the holiday was amazing.
"Would have been good to know that you cannot stay in Doha Airport over 24 hours as our flight which was rescheduled a few weeks before departure had 26 hours layover (and we had booked a hotel airside). We sorted it out, but would have done things differently had we known. <br/>Also, Kuoni did not provide a hotel voucher and at check in we were asked for it at least 4 times though they in the end resolved this."
Would like more local stores or opportunities to speak to sit face to face rather than talk on the phone.
Would not recommend. I got in touch about a 20k trip to Namibia. Spoke to Steve Yates and never received a quote or heard anything back. Shocking waste of time.
Would recommend Kuoni. Have used you twice to date
"Yes would recommend, very professional & efficient service"
"Yes, great service."
You are good but I may move to more economical options
You can’t improve. Everything from the initial phone call to the one that I received after I had returned from my holiday was amazing. Georgina is the most wonderful person. You are lucky to have her. She is incredibly genuine and you can tell she loves her job and just wants to make sure that her customers have the very best experience that they can.
You can't get better than Sam leckie at the Liverpool store
You didn't managed to find anything fir ys. Very disappointed
"You guys are top notch. Even your rep on Crete, Dimitria. You are all helpful and easy to get a hold of"
You have an excellent group in Peter Jones' store in Sloane Square.  I was (and have been in the past) very well looked after by Lucy Barry and her colleagues
You made everything so easy and the choices of hotel were excellent
"You provide good holidays, to good destinations, for relatively good value. The staff we've interacted with have all been very professional. The only reason this is not a 10 is because we couldn't book our holiday on the website - experienced a long sequence of errors regardless of the payment method - and we had to call and book on the phone (a less preferred option because it takes much longer). Furthermore, the price of the holiday was about 10% higher when booking on the phone, even with a discount generously applied by the agent. Overall that wasn't a good experience and in this day and age, we expect the digital process to be much smoother."
You quoted a figure to my Travel Agent that was far higher than was available just 24 hours later on the internet. I felt that he was clearly not offered a best rate
You sold us a FULLY inclusive package <br/>the Hotel had their own inclusive  package which did not include  certain key items .i. i.e. the main ala carte restaurant and the evenings one and only bar ?
You were very helpful and answered my questions
your africa tailor made price was too much for us. 40 per cent more than others
"Your in-house rep at the island just hid behind your terms and conditions! One of our bags was delayed which had all our sunscreen in and my husbands swim wear, instead of being helpful and offering sunscreen on 32 degrees, she said our T&C do say you may not get all luggage together, not helpful. She continued this theme through the holiday"
"Your prices were way more than other competitors, for 3xactly the same package"
Your representative was very helpful recommending a great hotel within our budget. She was very responsive and made herself available out of hours.
"Your sales assistant in Norwich, Kelly Ruth was extremely friendly and capable and found exactly the holiday we wanted."
"Your Sheffield meadowhall store and in particular Charlotte Housley is a credit to you and your company, she has booked many special holidays for us over the years and she always gets it spot on"
"You're a quality product, keep doing what you're doing."
